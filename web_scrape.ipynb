Adjusting this rule only helps large institutional money cut costs and hide potentially nefarious actions. It doesnât protect the general public in any way. Please help the general public keep an eye on our institutions. The governmentâs job is to protect itâs citizens. This change only helps the large investment institutions hide potentially fraudulent or risky activities. More transparency is always better for individual investors and the markets as a whole, so please reject this proposal. Thank you, Nathan Barron, Concerned Investor"

We are at the threshold of a major market reform, where public interest has never been so high. That being said: I am strongly OPPOSED to this proposal. Reporting and a public portfolio should be made public. Transparency is the cornerstone of a fair and just market. I strongly urge the commission to reject this proposal for the sake of the people. Not only for a select few. Justice will be done for those who seek to undermine and influence the market for personal/ political gain. It's only a matter of time."

We have to play by the rules but no one else does. Naked shorting, spoofing, darkpools are all intended to help the MM. They steal money from us and tell us the market is fair for everyone. What's worse the SEC turns a blind eye to these activities. How are we supposed to trust the people who are supposed to be protecting the individual investor? When you can put 90% of shares in the dark pool it kills any momentum a stock may have. Spoofing is illegal but I saw a 100,000 share spoof after closing. I know no one will read this and this is an exercise in futility but I am still trying. Gary G. Said to send in complaints so they could be voiced."

         "David Kwon December 20, 2022 Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, I am writing to you regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)âs proposal to update the 13(f) rule which was announced in 2020 . This proposal sparked a lot of debate and discussion about the benefits and costs of the 13(f) rule and about i nvestment disclosure more generally. For example, while the SECâs proposal suggested the existence of disclosure costs in the form of copycatting (and frontrunning) activities, a recent bill proposed by Congresswoman Maxine Waters to expand investment disc losure suggests that copycatting is minimal. My recent dissertation on the 13(f) rule (completed while I was in a n accounting PhD program at Yale University) addresses this debate and has relevant findings for this proposal. My dissertation found many iss ues with the 13(f) rule , which requires institutional investors to disclose stock holdings . First of all, despite the US government âs desire under the 13(f) rule to monitor institutional trading activity and monitor the impact of institutions on market stability especially in times of stress , the government curiously decided to only require stock s to be disclos ed, resulting in only about 15% of institutional assets being disclosed on 13(f) forms today . A full 85% of institutiona l investments is not being monitored by the government. The chart below shows in green the instruments that must be disclosed, and the instruments in grey that are not , and the following chart shows the percentage of institutional portfolios that is disclo sed across institutional categories. The 13(f) rule thus creates a discriminatory disclosure environment among institutional investors simply based on the instruments they use; a small - cap value manager has to disclose all of its portfolio (assuming it meets the 13(f) threshold), while a global macro hedge fund that uses only derivatives can keep its portfolio secret. The stock -specific nature of the 13(f) disclosure rule also means that institutions of similar size, similar type, or facing similar economic exposures can face different disclosure treatment under the rule.

I find that a subset of institutional stock investors â long -term stock investors (that are top -performing) â are the primary tar get of copycats due to lower replication risk. Copycats face lower risk when trying to copy long -term investors like Warren Buffett than when copying short -term investors because copycats are better able to successfully match the portfolio of long -term inv estors. For example, a simple strategy copying Buffettâs 13 (f) holdings would have generated 95% of Buffettâs annualized return performance over 40 years. In fact, t op-performing long -term stock investors, including long -term hedge funds and pension funds, face significant positive market reactions to their disclosures of newly purchased stock, while top -performing short -term stock investors do not see positive market reactions. In the two charts below, I first show market reactions to Warren Buffettâs stoc k disclosures and we can see that only his new stock purchases receive substantial market reactions upon disclosure, suggesting evidence of copycats, and in the next chart I show that among pension funds, only top -performing long -term pension funds experie nce a significant market reaction upon disclosure of newly purchased stock (shown by the blue line). Lastly, I show in portfolio simulations that while short -term investors, to the extent that they face any copycatting, likely benefit from the positive market reactions caused by outside copycats, long -term investors do not benefit and can even be harmed. The reason for this is that the positive market reactions due to copycatting merely frontload returns, rather than increase returns permanently. Take Warren Buffett for example, who may have some special insight into a specific stock. A long -term investor like Buffett may not expect to benefit over the long -run from the positive market reactions caused by outside copycats, if he expects his special insight on the stock to be incorporated into the stock price over time anyways, regardless of copycatting. In other words, assuming that market reactions from copycatting merely correct an undervaluation, a long -term investor is likely to not benefit from such market reactions over the long run. I test and confirm these predictions in a sample of hedge funds and pension funds. Since copycats cause long -term stock investors to experience excess volatility in their returns without higher returns, my study finds that long -term stock investors â risk - adjusted returns are being harmed under the 13 (f) rule. The chart belo w shows that copycatted stocks (those with high market reactions) do not outperform non -copycatted stocks for long - term hedge funds. However, high market reaction stocks do outperform for short -term and medium -term hedge funds. The following table below sh ows in portfolio simulations that copycatting activity negatively impacts targeted (i.e., copied) long -term investorsâ Sharpe ratios. The next chart shows that in my sample of long -term hedge funds , their Sharpe ratios are especially harmed when they have larger assets (when they are building up positions more often and therefore more likely to be harmed by copycatting). My study helps inform the government on the costs of investment disclosure as it contemplates whe ther to âfill in the gapsâ of disclosure. I show that when investment disclosure is required, this results in excess volatility in the stock holdings of top -performing long -term stock investors without benefitting their portfolio returns over time, and even sometimes harming portfolio returns over time as they grow larger in assets. So, my dissertation suggests that long -term stock investment (and therefore innovation, which requires a long -term investing horizon) in the economy is being disincentivized in favor of short -term trading under the 13(f) rule . Due to these significant public disclosure costs, while at the same time considering the governmentâs desire to monitor institutional activity in financial markets, I recommend that the government eliminate the 13(f) rule and create a new rule that require s large investors like institutions (and even individuals with significant assets) to disclose complete portfolio holdings privately to regulators . This would have the benefit of rem oving public disclosure costs while at the same time allowing those in the government with confidential access to monitor investment activity across asset classes and financial instruments and to look for excessive trading especially in time of stress , whi ch after all was the original vision of the 13(f) rule. Here is the link to my dissertation if you would like to read further. Thank you ! Sincerely, David Kwon"

         "December 28, 2020 Note: I used my sister's American phone number as this online form did not accept my Malaysian one. Aside fro that all other information are my own. I totally agree with Mr Phil Town that this proposed change will badly affect the smaller investors. As an investor from Malaysia, I decided to invest in the US stock market because of the relatively high level of transparency such as the quarterly and annual SEC filings Quarterly Earnings call and most of all the 13F filings that all us common investors to access information on what the large fund managers are doing. Compared to Malaysia where this information is impossible to find without connections to insiders. This has lead to the Malaysian stock market losing trust from the public as large investors release news to manipulate the market for their benefit. My family, including my parents and in-laws who have been trying to store their assets in the Malaysian market for decades, have since transferred their money over to the US Stock exchanges since I've told them about how transparent and easy it is to find information to make educated investments in the US. Though I am not an American citizen I know I speak for the foreign investors from countries that have less transparent stock exchanges when I say this proposed change to end the 13F filings for fund between 100million to 3.5 billion will hurt the common investor's ability to confidently invest in the US stock market. Please do not go through with this. We want and need this information."

         "November 11, 2020 I wish to be Anonymous because it does not matter who I am but rather what I do that defines me. Going from a threshold of 100 million to 3.5 billion is to large. I understand the reasons behind why 13f was created in the first place, I understand why the small manager has compliance costs and why they would want to be rid of them. However the aforementioned increase is to large, perhaps a middle ground compromise is in order. The uses of the 13f have evolved as the data points increased and this has had many unintended positive consequences. To eliminate so many small managers from the data points would eliminate all those positive consequences and findings. I understand the simple fix yet hard decision would be to raise the gate, but the question you pose is more complicated than that. That is why I propose amending 13f as you have stated while creating another separate filing that can cover the smaller dollar figures and smaller managers. A separate filing that can be much simpler, less comprehensive and less expensive. Certainly if the SEC can amend the forms then certainly they do not need congress to create a new one for them. The new filing could be called form \\\"13s\\\" homage to the 13f with the \\\"s\\\" standing for \\\"small\\\". Thank you for reading."

         "Nov. 10, 2020 Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are. Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. The âjustificationâ for the rule change is highly questionable. When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor? Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The S&P suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more."

Knowing that bigger investors are buying specific stocks of interest is a so helpful, because it's an indication of valuable and trusted companies. Information about the price, the percentage of an investors portfolio, and the price the stock was purchased at is so helpful in deciding if a particular company merits my purchase at this time for this price.Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the professional investors from filing.

As set forth in the Proposing Release, the Commission has proposed amendments to R ule 13f -1 (âRule 13f -1â) under Section 13(f) (â Section 13(f) â) the Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Act â) and Form 13F to increase the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion and to increase the information provided by institutional investment managers, respectively . United Therapeutics thanks the Commission for this opportunity to comment on the proposed amendm ents to R ule 13f -1 and Form 13F and the Commissionâs efforts to impr ove reporting by institutional investment managers . Summary of Our Comments We concur with the Commissionâs view that the R ule 13f -1 reporting system is outdated and in need of modernization. We are supportive of the Commissionâs objective s to âreflect the changes in the structure of the market that have occurred over time.â1 However, w e believe that the proposed revision to R ule 13f -1 is unlikely to accomplish Section 13(f)âs goal of âimprov[ing] the body of factual data available regarding t he holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitat[ing] consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities marketsâ2 or the Commissionâs objective of providing useful information to shareholde rs. 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34 -89290, 13, 20 (July 10, 2020) . 2 Id. at 9. 2 We believe that, as proposed, the change in threshold for reporting under R ule 13f -1 will instead impair the usefulness of the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers . The consequence will be a sign ificant loss of transparency into the shareholdings of our company and other publicly- traded companies in the market, thereby impeding companiesâ abilities to meaningfully engage with shareholders. Discussion A. Transparency 1. Shareholder Engagement Over the past several decades , Rule 13f -1 has been one of the driving factors in a remarkable evolution in companiesâ engagement with their shareholders . Each year, companies like ours discuss key concerns and initiatives with shareholders, both when preparing annual proxy statements and when considering significant company actions. Form 13F filings are integral and unique source s of ownership information for companies showing who their significant shareholders are, which is a starting point for shareholder engagement. Under the Commissionâs proposal, 89% of current Form 13F filers would go dark3, representing several steps back ward from this previously- achieved increase in company -shareholder engagement. While the Commissionâs rationale for increasing the threshold rests on creating parity with the portion of the market that was targeted at the time of the ruleâs initial adoption in 1975, this ignores the dramatic alteration in the relationships between companies and their shareholders since then. S hareholder engagement has become a market standard of good corporate governance , with the result that market participants have increasingly become productive company participants alongside management and boards of directors. Increasing the R ule 13f -1 threshold would allow the largest institutional investment managers to continue this participation, but could have the effect of exclud ing those shareholders with (relatively) smaller positions âeven if they are more active in the companyâs stock than some larger, more passive investor s. Management has limited time to devote to shareholder engagement and must choose which shareholders to prioritize . More information about all the companyâs significant investors , whether they be large or relatively small in scale, allows management to make better -informed decisions about how to allocate its time. For some companies , particularly smaller -cap companies , it may be information on the smaller, more active investors that is more valuable â both from the standpoint of engaging with interested shareholders and detecting activist hedge funds. Final ly, proxy advisor y firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass -Lewis have come to expect detailed disclosure regarding the extent of an issuer âs shareholder outreach efforts , which ofte n includes precise per centages of an issuer âs shares that were included in such 3 IHS Markit , SECâs 13F Proposal â Issuer and Investor Analysis , Corporate Secretary ( August 7, 2020), https://ihsmarkit.com/research -analysis/secs -13f-proposal --issuer -and-investor -analysis.html . 3 efforts. These disclosures would become i mpossible with out the information avai lable from Form 13F filings. 2. Detecting Activis m According to the IHS Markit, 86% of activist managers would go dark under the Commissionâs proposed new threshold, which will be a loss in transparency not for the biggest companies in the market, but for the smaller companies that are more frequently targeted by activists.4 Particularly in this time of market volatility due to COVID -19, more insight into how a companyâs stock is trading and held is needed, not less. With a $3.5 bill ion threshold, companies will have a diminished ability to monitor activist movement s that might take advantage of this market volatility. In addition, experts are warning that , just as activist investing ârose significantly after the 2008 financial crisi s,â it may spike as the economy rebounds from COVID -19.5 Indeed, â[a] ctivist investors may focus their attention on companies that â¦ already have significant activist representation in their stocks and those facing new vulnerabilities â6âthat is, those companies that most need the information provided by Form 13F about who is trading in and out of their stock. These same experts encourage companies to prepare for such activism by engaging with investors and monitoring changes in the companyâs shareholder base .7 With a 35x increase in the R ule 13f -1 reporting threshold, a company will not know if an activist investment manager is planning a proxy contest until that activist is compelled to disclose its position on Form 13D âthe deadline for which is 10 days after that threshold is crossed. Although this is a shorter time frame than the current Form 13F filing deadline, a moderate Form 13F filing threshold still increases the chance that an activist will have to report an accumulation of a companyâs stock before it reac hes the Form 13D threshold. It is also important to note that, since the adoption of Section 13(f) in 1975, the marketplace and media landscape have evolved in a way that has allowed small, vocal market participants to greatly increase their significance to public companies, including through use of derivative securities, which are not even subject to reporting under Rule 13f -1. Any consideration of changes to the reporting threshold must take this present reality into account. 3. Inadequate Alternativ es We recognize that there may be other ways for a company to determine its stock ownership, such as the use of private stock surveillance firms and Forms N -PORT and 13D/13G.

Even then, Forms 13D and 13G are not reliable when activists form âwolf packsâ whereby, acting in concert, each act ivist will accumulate less than 5% of a companyâs securities and then not report themselves as a 13D group. Under SEC rules, companies communicate with their beneficial owners primarily through broker or bank intermediaries. However, t he âOBO/NOBOâ rules allow a beneficial owner to prohibit direct contact by a company in which it holds stock if it objects to disclosure of its identity . Moreover, beneficial owner s can also prohibit disclosure of the amount of their holdings in a company. Thus, reliance on these other rules to give companies insight into their shareholder base would be misplaced . Any large shareholder that would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold for institutional investment managers could also elect to prohibit disclosure of its identity and/or holdings to a company through the OBO/NOBO rules. The rationale in the Proposing Release relies all too heavily on the purported high estimated compliance costs. While w e acknowledge that institutional investment manage rs are required to incur additional compliance costs when they are subject to Rule 13f -1, that cost, even for smaller investment managers , is not unduly burdensome. Developments in technology, which have given institutional investors instant access to det ailed information regarding their holdings and have allowed them to submit Form 13F electronically, have made compliance with this rule significantly easier and less costly than it was several decades ago. Given the lack of alternative sources for the inf ormation Rule 13f -1 provides to the marketplace , the value of this information to issuers and investors alike is significant. Not only is Rule 13f -1 straightforward and simple to comply with, but a single managerâs Form 13F typically provides valuable information to multiple companies and other investors. Thus, the benefits of the Rule 13f -1 reporting system far exceed the modest cost it imposes. B. Impact on Capital Formation While large shareholders are likely to have already adopted a positive position with respect to investing in that particular company, many companies use Forms 13F to identify smaller shareholders who have not yet invested a significant amount in the company but may be willing to. As another facet of shareholder engagement, management may reach out to these shareholders , not just for opinions on company actions, but also to discuss the possibility of making additional investments to provide the company with growth capital. Such a significant increase in the R ule 13f -1 reporting threshold cuts off companiesâ visibility and accessibility 8 Even after the 60 -day delay following the end of the investment company âs fiscal quarter , only the information from the last month of the fisc al quarter is made available. See General Instruction F to Form N -PORT. 5 regarding these smaller shareholders , thereby limiting companiesâ potential capital raising opportunities . For earlier -stage companies in the biotech industry, capital raising is an essent ial tool to speed the development of potential live -saving therapies. C. Effect on Our Company We strive to maintain strong relationships with our shareholders as part of our commitment to corporate governance. In 2019, members of our Board of Directors invited discussions with shareholders in the spring and in the fall who collectively hold about 70% of our outstanding shares. These conversat ions with shareholder s give us deeper insight into our shareholdersâ perspectives and help inform our Board of Director sâ decisions on strategy, governance, compensation, and sustainability. Some of the actions we have taken in response to shareholder feedback over the past several years include the adoption of majority voting, the adoption of proxy access, the de -classification of our Board of Directors, and the initiation of our environmental, social, and governance disclosure program. Notably, the design of our four -year equity grant for 2019- 2022 was in direct response to feedback received during our ongoing shareholder engagements. If the threshold for R ule 13f -1 is raised to $3.5 billion, we would expect to lose information on approximately 75% of our current Form 13F filers . Many of the remaining filers are passive holders that do not significantly change from quarter to quarter . As with many companies, especially small- and mid- cap companies, the information we gain on smaller investors from Form 13F filings is just as, if not more, important to our company than is the information on larger, passive investors. Over the past 12 months, we have engaged with over 40 investors who would not be required to file under the new threshold. D. Proposed Reforms We agree with the Commission that a reform of Rule 13f -1 is necessary and timely, including a possible increase to the threshold for filing. However, we urge the Commission to consider a more nuanced approach to the new filing threshold instead of a simpl e increase based on proportionate market share . We agree with the National Investor Relations Instituteâs proposal to increase the threshold to $450 million, which is based on a Consumer Price Index adjustment.9 Such an increase would be a less shocking to the market and, in tandem with the following additional reforms (particularly the first), would accomplish a more holistic approach to bringing Rule 13f -1 into the 21st century while also enhancing its usefulness. â¢ First, we recommend adjusting the filing threshold every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. This would provide ongoing review and consideration of the filing threshold as it relates to current market conditions. It would also set 9 National Investor Relations Institute , The Case for 13F Reform (September 25, 2019), https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019- final.pdf . Also, this assumes that the Commission has the authority to increase the th reshold above $100 million, which is not free from doubt as discussed in Section E. below. 6 compan iesâ and investorsâ expectations for the threshold, precluding undue reliance on a particular number. â¢ Second , we recommend shortening the reporting deadline from 45 days to 10 days after the end of the quarter. The significant delay between quarter -end and the filing deadline causes information to often be outdated when it is released to the market . This can allow an investor that purports to be a large shareholder to influence the company when, in fact, that investorâs position has changed since the last Form 13F filing.10 This can also allow activists to accumulate large portions of the companyâs stock early in a calendar quarter and leave the company in the dark as to its significant shareholders until several months later. In addition, t he 45- day reporting period was established 30 years ago and was the result of practical considerations that are no longer applicable in light of the increased sophistication of institutional investors and advances in information technology, which often all ow institutional managers to ascertain their exact holdings as of month end within a matter of minutes. Thirty years ago, computers, the Internet , and EDGAR were all in their infancy ; today we have technology that allows for real -time reporting. â¢ Third, we recommend that all filers be required to disclose long, short, derivative, and outright positions in a companyâs stock, and that all positions be aggregated together (not netted) to determine if the threshold is met. This would provide a more accurate picture of where an investor stands in relation to a particular company. â¢ Finally, we recommend that the Commission reconsider its current procedure for handling confidential treatment requests related to Form 13F filings . Institutiona l managers can request confidential treatment of specific positions, and the current system effectively grants confidential treatment during the period between application and final determination on a request, which can be several months long.11 Like the long deadline discussed in the first bullet above, this causes information to quickly become stale, thereby defeating the ruleâs purpose and function of providing the markets with transparency on holdings . E. Authority While we commend the Commission on its effort to reform R ule 13f -1, we are nevertheless concerned about its authority to do so under Section 13(f) in the proposed manner. Section 13(f) states, in relevant part, â[e] very institutional investment manager â¦ which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) â¦ having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in 10 National Investor Relations Institute, NIRI Advocacy Issues Survey â 2018 (August 2018) (46% of respondents reported that investors had misrepresented their positions to gain a meeting with the companyâs management ). 11 Christian Bonser, If You Only Knew the Power of the Dark Side: An Analysis of the One-Sided Long Position Hedge Fund Public Disclosure Regime and a Call for Short Position Inclusion, 22 Fordham J. Corp. & Fin. L. 327, 365 (2017) . 7 any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine , shall file reports with the Commission â¦â (emphasis added). A plain reading of the text shows that Congress set the upper limit at $100 million, and t he Commission has the authority to lower , but not increase, the threshold. For the amount to be raised, Congress needs to amend Section 13(f) to either raise the threshold or give the Commission the specific authority to do so. Conclusion We appreciate the Commission âs efforts, and willingness, to modernize Rule 13f -1; however, increasing the filing threshold to $3.5 billion will only serve to significantly reduce market transparency and impair many companiesâ ability to engage with their shareholders and detect activist activity in their stock by allowing a significant portion of current Form 13F filers to essentially go dark. We are of the opinion that the Commission does not thoroughly consider and address this loss of transparency in the Proposing Release âindeed, as Commissioner Lee notes in her dissent, â[t]he costs of losing transparency are glossed over in brief narrative form and largely discounted.â12 Because t he alternative sources of information are incomplete and, in some cases, prohibitively expensive, w e urge the Commission to take a more measured approach to the Rule 13f -1 filing threshold, and propose revisions to it in tandem with other reforms that would enhance the usefulness of information f rom the Rule 13f -1 disclosure system. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Proposing Release and respectfully request that the Commission consider our re commendations and suggestions.

We focus on issues affecting the profession of financial analysis and investment management, education and competencies for investment professionals, and on issues of fairness, transparency, and accountability of global financial markets. Executive Summary Considerations of market trans parency and integrity lead us to oppose the Proposal. The Proposal would raise the 13(f) filing threshold by a factor of 35 times, from $100 million in assets under management to $3.5 billion. Nearly 90 percent of current filers, comprising more than 4,500 institutional investment managers with $2.322 trillion in reported assets, would no longer be subject to the 13(f) filing requirement.3 The resulting loss of holdings information would harm market participants such as, among others, investors, issuers, re searchers, and the affected institutional investment managers themselves. We consider the proposed 35 -fold increase in the reporting threshold to be excessive and, moreover, inconsistent with the Commissionâs recent decision against adjusting the financia l 1 CFA Institute is a global, not -for-profit professional association of nearly 171,400 investment analysts, ad visers, portfolio managers, and other investment professionals in 165 countries, of whom more than 164,000 hold the Chartered Financial AnalystÂ® (CFAÂ®) designation.

Comm ân, File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (July 10, 2020 ), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf [hereinafter Reporting Threshold Release]. 3 Based on numbers in âTable 1: Form 13F Reporting Threshold Changes,â Reporting Threshold Release at 16 -17. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 2 thresholds in the accredited investor definition. We believe it is the accredited investor definition, rather than the 13(f) reporting requirement, that needs updated thresholds.4 The Commission argues the higher proposed threshold would purport with th e purpose of the Act, which it suggests is to focus exclusively on large institutional investment managers. According to this argument, the growth of securities markets has rendered the original (and current) reporting threshold of $100 million irrelevant to the Actâs focus on large investment managers. In our view, the enabling statute, in section 13(f)(1), only gives the Commission authority to lower the threshold, not to raise it. Therefore, the Proposal conflicts to with the legislative history and Con gressional intent. We also believe the Proposal would run counter to other statutory objectives, such as the needs to build investor confidence, enable issuers to identify their beneficial owners, afford an understanding of the effect of institutional inv estor activities on individual securities, and serv as a single centralized repository of certain holdings data. And finally, we believe the economic analysis falls short in establishing a baseline of current practices and assessing the costs and benefits of the proposed rulemaking in a thorough and impartial manner.5 Discussion of the Proposal How Investors and Others Use and Benefit from 13(f) Disclosures The elimination of 13(f) data on the scale proposed in this rulemaking would have a harmful effect on securities markets and their participants, including, among others, investors, issuers, and institutional investment managers themselves. The significant number of letters from investors who use and value the 13(f) disclosures that would be lost under this Proposal should alert the Commission to the disclosuresâ value to market participants. It also provides strong evidence that the proposed reduction in d isclosures would undermine investor confidence, thus undermining one of the statutory objectives of the 13(f) framework. The comment file also makes clear that market participants benefit from 13(f) disclosures in a variety of ways. Investors use the fili ngs for due diligence on smaller investment managers. The loss of the holdings data, therefore, would impede such due diligence and potentially reduce demand for smaller investment managers, the group of investment managers the Proposal is intending to ben efit. 4 See James C. Allen, CFA Institute Comment Letter on Amending the âAccredited Investorâ Definition (May 4, 2020), at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -25-19/s72519 -7159328 -216511.pdf . 5 SEC, Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings , Memorandum (March 6, 2012), available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf [hereinafter Cur rent Guidance]. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 3 Investors also use the data to detect fraud;6 and to analyze hedge fundsâ crowded trades7 and assess levels of their crowding risk;8 and to aid in price discovery.9 Consequently, the loss of these disclosures would likely have a significant and nega tive effect on investors as well as on market risks and efficiency. Securities issuers use 13(f) data to identify beneficial owners, particularly for smaller issuers that lack the resources to engage a proxy solicitor to understand their shareholder bases .10 It is, in fact, the smaller institutional investors that are more likely to hold securities of small -cap companies.11 Therefore, eliminating their 13(f) holding filing would likely harm small -cap issuers, in particular, and ultimately impede issuer outre ach and issuer -shareholder dialogue, good -governance practices the Commission has specifically encouraged.12 The Proposal suggests that the relevant data from smaller institutional investors is unneeded because of their limited ability to affect securities markets.13 While that may be true for the largest of large cap stocks, investment managers with AUM between $100 million and $3.5 billion do have significant potential to move the prices of small or mid -cap securities which, as noted above, they tend to ho ld more frequently than large managers. What matters is not the total assets managed by a manager, but the volume of buy or sell transaction(s) the firm generates in comparison with a securityâs trading depth and liquidity. This is a particularly relevant consideration because, again, these smaller managers are more likely to hold the stocks of 6 See Doron Cohen, Hedge Fund Due Diligence , comment letter on File No. S7 -08-20, (July 14, 2020 ), at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415172 -219344.htm . 7 Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg, âGoldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding,â (July 20, 2020), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 8 Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg, âGoldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding,â (July 20, 2020), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 9 Joanna Ossinger , Bloomberg, âGoldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding ,â (July 20, 2020 ), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 10 See, e.g., National Investor Relations Institute, The Case for 13F Reform (Sept. 25, 2019), available at https://www.niri.org /NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019 -final.pdf (observing, âThe lack of ownership transparency is of particular concern to smaller issuers that cannot afford to pay for stock surveillance firms that analyze trading patterns and try to de termine which investors are buying or selling shares.â) 11 Proposal at 23, citing Blume and Keim as âproviding evidence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocks â¦â). 12 Chair Mary Jo White, Remarks at the 10th Annual Transatlantic Corporate Governance Dialogue, (Dec. 3, 2013), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2013 -spch110313mjw , (saying, â Engagement with shareholders should mean more than just mailing out the annual proxy statement and conducting the annual meeting. It should mean proactive outreach, and clear, direct, and honest communications about how and why decisions are being made. â). 13 Proposal at 25 -26, (saying âWe be lieve that it is necessary to continue to provide regulators and the public information regarding the equities holdings of larger managers that have the potential to significantly affect the securities markets. The need for public disclosure of holdings of smaller managers is less compellingâ¦[T]he dollar value of the aggregate holdings of the smaller managers that would no longer be required to file reports on Form 13F under the proposal represent a small percentage of 13(f) securities overall.â) Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 4 smaller companies.14 The 13(f) disclosures, therefore, provide valuable information that would be lost under this Proposal. Academic researchers, too, use the 13(f) d ata to discern and analyze a variety of investing trends, including, for example, track the rise of passive and index investing. Academic research plays an essential part in creating an informed marketplace, informed investors, and informed regulators.15 Finally, attorneys use these filings in private securities class action matters, including determining lower -bound estimates of damages. Such private actions have important and positive spill-over benefits for enforcement, as the Proposal describes.16 The P roposal suggests users might be able to find similar data from alternative disclosure sources. The alternatives cannot, however, replace the 13(f) framework, which serves as a central repository of holdings data.17 Increase in the Reporting Threshold The proposed 35 -fold increase in the reporting threshold, together with the elimination of information about89.2 percent of current filers, goes well beyond the rate of inflation, which would result in an increase of four or five times (to $400 million or $50 0 million).18 Rather, the Commission chooses to base the change in threshold on the growth in the markets and entities it regulates.19 While we would not expect the Commission to suggest limiting its regulatory activities to only the largest regulated enti ties, this Proposal proposes something analogous: namely, to drastically reduce the number of investment managers subject to the disclosure rule because of the growth of capital markets. It is in the contrast of the Commissionâs approach to addressing chan ges over time in these thresholds with the approach applied in the accredited investor definition where the disparities are most glaring. In the newly adopted amendments to the accredited investor definition, for instance,, the Commission rejected adjustme nts to its wealth and income thresholds to address nearly four decades of inflation where an effective threshold is needed to ensure retail accredited investors have the financial ability, investing understanding, and access to advisory support to 14 Proposal at 23, citing Blume and Keim as âproviding evidence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocksâ¦â) . 15 The Commissionâs guidance on economic analysis states, âIn addition to the direct benefits and co sts, the economic analysis should address significant ancillary economic consequences.â If the impact on academic research is considered to be an ancillary economic consequence, it would still be significant and should be analyzed alongside the impact on d irect market participants. Current Guidance at 10. 16 The Proposal states, âCommission staff has noted that âmeritorious private actions have long been recognized as an important supplement to civil and criminal law -enforcement actions.ââ Proposal at 22, fo otnote 51 . 17 We discuss this in more detail on page 8 . 18 According to the Proposal, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (âPCEâ) would result in a reporting threshold of $500 million and $400 million, respec tively. Proposal at 20. 19 See, e.g., SEC, Fiscal Year 2021 Congressional Budget Justification at 30, at https://www.sec.gov/files/secfy21congbudgjust.pdf , (saying, âMost importantly, the siz e of the SEC -regulated community continues to grow in volume and complexity, and significantly exceeds existing resource levels.â) Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 5 invest i n illiquid, opaque, and higher risks of fraud of private markets. These are palpable risks that can be financially devastating to such investors. No comparable risks or regulatory burdens confront institutional investment managers subject to this disclosur e. According to the Proposal, investment firms would enjoy direct savings of only $15,000 to $30,000 per filer per year (assuming, as valid, proposed compliance estimates that are in question.) It is inconsistent that the Commission would reject the oppor tunity to adjust the accredited investor wealth thresholds for inflation and then propose a 35x increase for the 13(f) reporting threshold. Should the Commission decide to proceed with this Proposal, we recommend 2010 as the base year for growth, rather th an 1975. Though Congress first adopted 13(f) legislation in 1975, it chose to retain that same threshold when it amended that very sentence in the Dodd -Frank Act, which became law on July 21, 2010.20 Since then, the S&P 500 has increased by a factor of 3.3 times. Therefore, a proportional change in the 13(f) reporting threshold would increase it to $330 million, not $35 billion. Finally, we hope the proposed 35 -fold increase will not drive a process that results in a less extreme but still unwarranted increa se.21 Assumptions of the Proposal The Proposal is based on an argument that the purpose of the Act was to provide information about large institutional investment managers that have the power to affect the markets. Thus, by removing filing obligations fo r nearly 90 percent of current filers, the Proposal âis designed to reflect proportionally the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million represented in 1975.â22 In this view, the information to be eliminated is unneeded, because the universe of t hose smaller institutional investors and their holdings were not originally intended to be captured by the statute.23 We find this argument inappropriate and extraneous. The only language relevant to the Commissionâs interpretation, application, and enforc ement of this mandate is in the statute, which requires 13(f) reports from institutional investment managers with AUM âof at least $100,000,000 or such lesser 20 See Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, SEC. 13A. Reporting and Recordkeeping for Certain Security -Based Swaps (amending Section 13(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ). 21 An analogous process played out with the Proxy Advisory rulemaking, with the Commission first proposing but eventually removing a requiring for two sets of issuer reviews before a proxy advisory firm could send its report to its clients. If the final rule can be perceived as a compromise, it is one proceeding from an egregious starting position. The final rule will still result in an unacceptable interference in the indepen dence of proxy advisory firms. 22 Proposal at 12. 23 See also Proposal at 21 ( âThe legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed to focus on larger managers â¦We believe that section 13(f) was intended to provide tran sparency into a certain segment of the securities markets âthe equity holdings by larger institutional investment managers.â ). Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 6 amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall fi le reportsâ¦â24 The proposal to raise the threshold above $100 million , therefore, conflicts with the explicit language of the statute itself. More over, Congress recently , by default, reaffirmed this intention in the 2010 amendment that left the $100 million threshold intact.25 Even if the Commission were to show that its authority derived from another section of the statute, it would face the additional hurdle of showing that an increased threshold s omehow better reflected Congressional intention when the Act expressly included in 13(f)(1) the limiting phrase, âor such lower amount.â The Proposal also cites a report of the SEC Inspector General (âIG Reportâ) that recommended the Commission âdetermine whether an increase in the threshold amount should be pursued.â26 The IG Report clearly implied the need for the Commission to seek legislative authority before it could raise the threshold above $100 million. Specifically, Recommendation 10 states that various Divisions and Offices within the Commission, including those of the General Counsel and the Chairmanâs Office, âshould determine whether legislative changes to Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should be sought , specifically with re spect toâ¦[a number of measures, including] increasing the Section 13(f) reporting threshold.â27 Finally, it cites section 13(f)(3) as giving the Commission authority to exempt any manager or class of managers from the reporting requirements of section 13(f) . Application of the phrase, âany class of managers,â to exempt nearly 90% of firms currently reporting under the rule is not just questionable as to its suitability but also whether it defeats the explicit instruction of 13(f)(1). It is also unclear wheth er such an interpretation could withstand court challenge, but also raises the question of whether such a use of finite and limited Commission funding is best used for this purpose. Thus, the context shows that Congressional focus on the largest instituti onal investment managers was qualified with respect to timing (âlimited initiallyâ) and start -up efficiencies (ârapid implementation while minimizing costs and burdensâ).

Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 7 forth the possibility that the Commission might determine to expand the regulation to cover investment managers that fell under the initial $100 million threshold. The proposed increase in the filing threshold also would run counter to several other objectives of the Act. These include the following objectives, all noted above: to increase investor confidence;28 to gain an understanding of the impact of institutional investment activities on individual securities;29 to help issuers identify beneficial owners; and to serve as a central repository of the reported holdings data. The Proposal suggests that alternative sources of holdings data âmay provide overlapping or similar data to that included on Form 13F.â30 Specifica lly, it names two such sources: mutual fund holding data filed on Form N -PORT, and a future consolidated audit trail (CAT) of trading activity in National Market System securities.31 In addition, one might also consider Schedule 13d or 13g data as potential alternatives. Reliance on such alternatives, however, would defeat a central purpose of the 13(f) framework: namely âto achieve uniform, centralized reportingâ of the holdings data.32 Instead, the Proposal would resurrect for most firms the very dispersion problem that the 13(f) legislation was designed to solve. Moreover, the two specifically named alternative sources would fail to replace the proposed loss of current 13(f) disclosures. Form N -PORT contains holdings data filed by registered investment comp anies, a category that comprises a subset of the universe of institutional investment managers that file 13(f) holdings data. And not only is the CAT not yet in existence, its future development is far from certain. And even if the CAT becomes a reality, its transactions data would not be publicly disclosed and therefore could not serve as an alternative source for the public. Nor would the data in Schedules 13D or 13G serve to meet investorsâ needs, given that they are limited to of investors who have acq uired more than 5 percent of a companyâs equity securities. These disclosures would fail to capture any holdings under the 5 percent ownership threshold, regardless of the size of the investment manager. For these reasons, we disagree with the principal c ontention in the Release that the proposal would return the universe of 13(f) filers and filings to a more faithful representation of the original statutory intent. 28 See Senate Report, at 82 (saying, â Thus, with the dissemination of data about institutional investment managers, an institutional disclosure program should stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of our securities markets. â 29 Proposal at 23, ( citing Blume and Keim as âproviding evi dence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocks.â). 30 Proposal a t 24. 31 Proposal at 24-25. 32 15 U.S. Code Â§ 78m . Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 8 Concerns with the Economic Analysis The Economic Analysis contained in this Proposal does not adhere to the Commissionâs own standards, as articulated in its own guidance on the topic. The Proposal falls short in establishing a baseline of current practices and impartially assessing the costs and benefits of the proposed rulemaking. 33 We note that the Proposal contains no separate section for the Economic Analysis, but instead offers comments scattered throughout the text.34 A separate section focused on the Economic Analysis would make clear its level of rigor, depth and soundness.35 Likewi se, the Economic Analysis should clearly label the analysis of the baseline. While the Proposal includes components of a baseline, the word itself never appears in the Proposal. The Baseline The Economic Analysis establishes a baseline against which to mea sure the likely economic consequences of the proposed regulation. The baseline is âthe best assessment of how the world would look in the absence of the proposed action.â36 It should describe not only the investment managers that file 13(f) disclosures, but also who uses the data, how they use it, and what benefits they derive from it.37 The descriptions should be quantified to the extent possible. In its request for public comments, the Proposal asks the right questions about who uses the data and what the benefits of those uses are for investors and the market.38 The Proposal answers these questions with minimal detail. It simply says: 33 SEC, Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings , Memo (March 6, 2012), available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf (identifying the elements as follows: â(1) a statement of the need for the proposed action; (2) the definition of a baseline against which to measure the likely economic consequences of the proposed regulation; (3) the identification of alternative regulatory approaches; and (4) an evaluation of the benefits and costs âboth quantitative and qualitative âof the proposed action and the main alternatives identified by the analysis. â). 34 The Proposal devotes a separate section to the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Analysis , and the economic analysis leans heavily on the PRA estimate. A PRA estimate, however, has more limited purposes than the economic analysis and cannot serve as a substitute for it. See RSFI and OGC, Memorandum: Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings, (March 6, 2012), at 11, available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf (stating, âWith most rules, the cost estimate that results from multiplying PRA burden -hours by hourly wage rates is not substitutable for the broader analysis of a ruleâs likely economic consequences contained in the Proposalâs economic analysis.â) 35 While not necessary in all rul emaking releases, a dedicated section for the economic analysis would be especially helpful here, because of its deficiencies. See Current Guidance at 15. 36 Current Guidance at 6. 37 Current Guidance at 7 (â Defining the baseline typically involves identifyi ng and describing the market(s) and participants affected by the proposed rule. Most SEC rules affect one or more markets directly but it may also be appropriate to consider additional markets or participants that may be indirectly affected by the proposed rule. â). 38 See, e.g., Question 11 at 2 8 (âWho uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and few er filers report?â) and Question 9 at 27 (âWhat, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers?â). Proposal at 27 and 28. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 9 [T]he pool of users of the data has expanded to include academics, market researchers, the media, attorneys pursuing securit ies class action matters, and market participants (including institutional investors themselves) who use the data to enhance their ability to compete. The data can also assist individuals in making investment decisions, investment managers in managing asse ts, and corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock. Commission staff also uses Form 13F information for a variety of purposesâ¦39 This does not go beyond that brief description and ex plain how users actually use the data and what benefits they derive from it. Assessing Costs of the Proposed Regulation The Economic Analysis also should include a thorough and impartial analysis of the potential costs and benefits of eliminating the 13(f) filing requirement for affected investment managers.40 In an earlier section, we identified a variety of users of 13(f) disclosures, the benefits they derive from those disclosures, and the harms that the loss of that data would entail.41 The economic analysis should assess with particularity how the proposed loss of data would affect each of these users and the market as a whole. Instead, the Economic Analysis offers little beyond a generalized assessment of these costs of the Proposal. For instance, the Proposal offers the following remark: âWhether any of these Form 13F data users find the data from smaller managers to be valuable would depend on their particular use of this data.â In addition, the Proposal asserts without evidence, âWe believe that the investing public specifically would be less concerned about the availability of portfolio holdings of these smaller managers because the activities of these smaller managers are not likely to cause market effects of the type contemplated by section 13 (f).â42 As noted above, however, investment managers with assets between $100 million and $3.5 billion can have on material impact on the price of small or mid -cap securities. Whereas the Proposal bases its estimate of the benefits the higher threshold (in the form of compliance cost savings) on unspecified âoutreachâ to the affected asset managers, there is no comparable mention of any outreach to investors or other users to determine the potential costs of the 13(f) disclosures. Such outreach could bolste r understanding of the costs to eliminate 13(f) filing requirements for affected filers. And judging from the comment file, users and other market participants are not shy in expressing their views on this question. 39 Proposal a t 22. 40 Current Guidance at 4 (stating, â[A]n ev aluation of the benefits and costs âboth quantitative and qualitative âof the proposed action and the main alternatives identified by the analysis.â ); and at 14 (Noting that the evaluation should â[f]rame costs and benefits neutrally and consistently.â ). 41 These include instilling investor confidence , gaining an understanding of the market impact of investment managersâ trading, and providing a range of other investor benefits. I ssuer s rely on the holdings information to identify their beneficial owners. In addition, the data is used in academic research and in private securities litigation, which in turn benefits civil and criminal law -enforcement actions . See supra discussion at 2 -4. 42 Proposal a t 24. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 10 Assessing Potential Benefits of the Proposal Congress set the $100 million threshold in 1975, and effectively reaffirmed it in 2010. In intervening decades, the advent of the IT revolution has brought advances in accounting and reporting software solutions to reduce processing and production costs. The Proposal tentatively acknowledges this, saying, âWe believe that some of the direct compliance costs associated with preparing filings on Form 13F have decreased since 1975, principally due to lower -cost information processing systems.â It then downplays the significance of these lower costs by stating, â[I]n connection with staff outreach to advisers to smaller fund complexes, these advisers stated that reporting on Form 13F involves significant compliance burdens.â These findings run counter t o what we heard from CFA Charterholders who work in investment management firms and are familiar with 13(f) reporting. For example, the president of one investment management firm told us most firms with assets under management of more than $100 million ha ve portfolio accounting software programs that easily create reports. It is then a simple step to upload the reports to the SEC website for filing purposes. Not without controversy,43 the Proposal estimates total direct compliance costs at $113.6 million, or four times larger than the estimated $31.2 million that the Commission accepted just two years ago.44 The new estimate would translate into a direct compliance cost savings of $15,000 to $30,000 annually for each affected investment manager ($4,100 to $8 ,200 under the previously estimated rate) that would no longer have to file Forms 13F.45 Commissioner Lee offers an alternative estimate, based on the previous cost estimate, of $4,000 to 5,000 per affected manager.46 The Proposal asserts it âwould provide m eaningful regulatory relief for smaller managersâ without estimating cost savings in a quantitative context. The economic analysis should compare its estimated cost savings of $15,000 to $30,000 per manager to their other financial metrics, such as their a verage total compliance costs, average net income, average revenue, or average assets under management.47 At maximum â for a manager with $100 million of reported assets and an annual compliance cost of $30,000 â the total cost savings would amount to 3 bas is points (or 0.03 percent) of reported assets.48 The average percentage for the entire pool of affected managers would be far less, given that their assets would range from $100 million to $3.5 billion and the cost savings could be lower than $30,000. 43 See, e.g., Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting , (July 10, 2020), at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 44 The increase is driven, not by higher filing costs over the past two years, but instead by a proposed change in calculating those costs. Proposal at 41 -45. The Proposal bases the proposed change on staff analysis and unspecified âoutreach to managers.â Pr oposal at 18. 45 Proposal at 18. 46 Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, (July 10, 2020), at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 47 If the Commission lacks all t he data to make these calculations, it should make reasonable assumptions to fill in any gaps . Failing that, it should explain why it cannot make such calculations. 48 This assumes that that $30,000 represents the incremental savings. The savings would be less if the manager had to devote some of the same resources to fulfill other accounting , reporting , or investment needs. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 11 In our view, the estimated benefits would be far outweighed by the harm to transparency, market integrity, and investor needs. The Proposal also identifies two potential sources of indirect compliance costs: the possibility of front -running or copycatting bas ed on 13(f) disclosures. To conduct such analyses, however, the economic analysis must first provide evidence that the disclosures lead to these practices, and second, demonstrate that such practices cause harm to the affected filers. It couches these possibilities in tentative terms: Consequently, Form 13F data of smaller managers may be more likely to be used by other market participants to engage in behavior that is damaging to the manager and the beneficial owners of the managed portfolio, such as fro nt running (which primarily harms the beneficial owners) or copycatting (which potentially harms the portfolio manager)â¦14 Moreover, the current framework permits a 45 -day filing deferral to avoid these misadventures. They also may avoid these problems by requesting confidential treatment to protect their trades and trading strategies. The Proposal implies that the affected filers are more likely to request confidential treatment, noting that 75% of all Form 13F CTRs filed come from the targeted group of m anagers who account for 9.2% of total market AUM.49 A more relevant comparison, in our view, comes from comparing the frequency of confidentiality requests from the affected group against their prevalence in the total population of filers (89.2%).50 It is therefore reasonable to conclude that affected filers have less need for such confidentiality requests and are less likely to suffer harm from their 13(f) disclosures. The Pr oposal asserts, âThe academic literature provides partial evidence about th e harm caused by the actions of third parties that is applicable in the context of the proposed amendments.â51 However, the most relevant study, the Christofferson Paper, finds that 13(f) filers strategically delay disclosures out of concern of front -runnin g, not copycatting.52 The study does not whether the delays succeed in protecting filers from front -running but does observe that investment institutions would benefit from copycatting if they intended to sell their recently purchased shares into a rising m arket.53 The same paper finds that small funds are less likely than larger funds to delay their disclosures, suggesting they see little need to protect themselves from front -running or copycatting. By 49 Proposal at 14. 50 Smaller managers also may have limited resources with which to file Form 13F CTRs to protect their competitive positions. 51 Proposal at 19. 52 See e.g., Susan E.K. Christoffersen, Erfan Danesh, and David Musto, Why Do Institutions Delay Their Shareholdings? Evidence from Form 13F , (Working Paper, June 11, 2018) (hereinafterâChistoffersen et alâ), available at https:// www.bwl.unimannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/bwl/Area_Finance/Finance_Area_Seminar/HWS2018/Chris toffersen_Paper.pdf (stating, â We look at 14 years of 13F filings to gauge the role of these three motives in the decision to delay disclosure, and the results indi cate that front -running and voting, but not copycatting, motivate delays. â). 53 Chistoffersen et al at 21 Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 12 extension, the same evidence casts doubt on the need fo r regulatory relief to protect these investment managers from such practices. The Proposal cites only one study whose findings suggest harm from 13(f) disclosures, and those to a distinct and limited group of hedge funds. This study found the investment pe rformance of these hedge funds declined after they began to file 13(f) disclosures.54 The affected hedge funds were characterized by an assortment of idiosyncratic features, including portfolios with more illiquid stock holdings, lower turnover rates, great er portfolio concentration, less conventional trading strategies, etc.55 Thus, even accepting that the 13(f) disclosures actually caused (and were not merely correlated with) declining investment performance, the question remains as to whether the experienc es of this unique group of hedge funds should be projected onto a larger pool of 13(f) filers and the extent, if at all, to base policymaking on those findings. Conclusion We do not support the Proposalâs recommendation to increase the reporting threshol ds for Form 13F to $3.5 billion from the current $100 million. We believe such a change would undermine market transparency that many investors, issuers, academics, and others have come to expect from these reports. We also contend that the purported cost savings to issuers are minimal in comparison with the costs to investors in lost information, and to the markets in terms of reduced trust, that are likely to come from the Proposals provisions.

Countryman Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 rule-comments@sec.gov Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (File No. S7-8-20) Dear Chairman and Secretary: Commenting on the above referenced proposed rule (the âProposalâ) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ or the âCommissionâ) concerning rules for fundraising in private markets. The Commission should reconsider its misguided proposal to raise the reporting threshold under Form 13F for institutional investment managers. Such a decision would significantly obstruct transparency across publicly traded stocks and contradict the Commissionâs stated mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. This proposal would raise the Form 13F reporting threshold by an astounding thirty five fold, from $100 million to $3.5 billion in eligible securities. Clearly this represents a very striking reduction in reporting requirements. The threshold change would by the Commissionâs own estimates reduce filings from investment managers by 89.2%. This reduction would harm investors seeking to understand the ownership patterns and management influences of companies they own, issuers looking to engage their shareholders, academics and data providers who are able to conduct studies with the information provided, and the public and policy makers seeking to understand important public policy issues.

Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Thre shold for Institutional Investment Managers ( Release No. 3 4â89290 ; File No. S7â08â20). Dear Secretary Countryman : Better Markets1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the above -captioned rule proposal (âReleaseâ or âProposalâ ) noticed for public comment by the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ or âCommissionâ). The Release2 proposes to amend the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports used by institutional investment managers from the current $100 million to $3.5 billion. The Commission argues that since the threshold was set in 1975, the U.S. equities market has grown and that there are now more institutional investors that are subject to the $100 million trigger than in 1975. The Release also would inc rease the information provided by those institutional investment managers âthose that have holdings above $3.5 billion âby eliminating the omission threshold for individual securities, and requiring the managers to provide additional identifying information. Finally, the Release would make certain technical amendments, including to modernize the structure of data reporting and amend the instructions on Form 13F for confidential treatment requests in light of a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.3 We oppose the 35-fold increase of the threshold. Our opposition is informed by a simple and compelling fact: the Commission lacks the authority to raise the threshold. Our letter will focus on this by presenting the complete legislative and regulatory hi story leading up to the enactment of the provisions that required the disclosure of Form 13F information. The Release omits material facts regarding this history, which creates a misrepresentation and misimpression of the Commissionâs authority. Our letter a ims to correct this misimpression by providing the omitted facts. 1 Better Markets is a non -profit, non -partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street, and make our financial system work fo r all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies â including many in finance âto promote pro -market, pro -business, and pro -growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americansâ jobs, savings, retiremen ts, and more. 2 See, Release No. 34 â89290; File No. S7 â08â20, 85 Fed. Reg. 46016 (July 31 , 2020) available at https:/ /www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/31/2020 -15322/reporting -threshold -for-institutional - investment -managers . 3 See, Release at 46016. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 2 We also oppose the 35-fold increase âwhich would permit nearly 90% of current institutional investment managers to go dark âbecause it is patently anti -transparency .4 The information provided by institutional investment managers through the required disclosure of Form 13F (at the current $100 million threshold) is vital information necessary for investors to make informed investment decisions.5 The essential nature of that information is demonstrated by the fact that âout of the hundreds of forms that SECâs EDGAR system hosts and makes available for download âForm 13F is the 6th most downloaded form.6 This information is also used by journalists, academics, third -party data, and information processors âall of which augment investorsâ ability to make more informed decisions. The disclosure of that information also helps issuers to better engage their shareholders, which often could pre empt and prevent costly and unnecessary friction between shareholders and the management of an issuer. The information contained in Form 13F also helps regulators study , examine, punish, and deter trading practices by institutional investment managers (and the broker -dealers that serve them) t hat degrade market quality and harm investors. COMMENTS Commission Lacks the Authority to Increase the Threshold 35 -fold. The Notice Omits Several Material Facts Regarding the Legislative and Regulatory History that Mandated the Form 13F Disclosures . This Omission Creates a Misimpression of the Commissionâs Authority. While the Commission is faithful in representing in the Release the enacted language of Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act as authorizing the Commission âto set reporting threshold in an amount of âat least $100,000,000 or such less er amountâ by ruleâ7 the Commission then proceeds to quote and re ly upon a Senate Banking Committee Report (that accompanied the Senate -passed version of the bill ) that states that the Commission would have âauthority to raise or l ower the threshold .â8 The Release also states that another prov ision of the enacted law affords the Commission broad authority to exempt any institutional investment manager from the requirements of Section 13(f) of the Excha nge Act. The Commission cites these two sources: (1) the Senate Banking Committee Report language , and; (2) the provision that authorizes the Commission to exempt any institutional investment manager from the requirements of Section 13(f) as legal authority to increase the threshold 35 -fold. But the Release omits several material facts in representing the legislative and regulatory context that gave birth to the provisions requiring the 13F disclosures, and the Commission conveniently mis -reads the exemptiv e authority 4 See, generally, Commissioner Allisson Herren Lee âs dissent outlining serious shortcomings of the Proposal, including the Commission âs questionable use of its e xemptive autho rity (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 5 See, generally, Barbara Roper âs Comment Letter in response to the Release , particularly pp. 3-8, on the usefulness of the Form 13F data , (September 1 6, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7777971 -223451.pdf . 6 See Comment Letter in response to the Release by Mary Barth, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University; Travis Dyer, SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University; Wayne Landsman, Kenan - Flagle r Business School, University of North Carolina; and Daniel J Taylor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania , (September 16, 2020) , available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7793920 -223568.pdf . 7 See Release at 46031. 8 See Release at 46031, and also Report to Accompany S.249, Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Sen.

Both these factors amount to a regulatory malpractice which alone should be grounds for the Commission to withdraw the Release. Commission Lacks Authority to Increase the Threshold. Section 13(f) is unambiguous in setting the threshold . The threshold applies to âevery institutional investment manager â¦having an aggregate fair market value â¦of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine .â9 Nowhere else in the authorizing language does Congress suggest that the Commission may set the threshold higher than $100,000,000. Congress also set the direction that the Commission may go in changing the threshold, and that is only downwards , which would have increased the number of reporting entities. The following legislative and regulatory history only serves to reinforce this directive. Section 13(f) came about after an extensive study of the institutional investment industry. Starting 1968, Congress , in a joint -resolution , directed the Commission âto make a study and investigation of t he purchase, sale and holding of securities by institutional investors of all types in order to determine the effect of such purchases, sales and holdings upon the maintenance of fair and orderly securities markets , the stability of such markets , the inter ests of the issuers and upon the interests of the public .â10 This multi -year stud y culminated into a multi -volume report that detailed significant shortcoming s in the regulation of the institutional investment industry . The same study also highlighted information al gaps t hat prevent ed the Commission from more robustly regulating the markets. Among these recommendations were the request the Commission made to Congress to authorize the Commission to require the disclosure of the portfolio holdings of institutional investors. Three years following the transmittal of the â Institutional Investor Study Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission â to Congress , both the Senate and the House begun holding hearings on the matter. At a two -day hearing, the U.S. Senate Banking Com mittee âs Subcommittee on Securities heard from several witness es, including then SEC Chairman Ray Garrett .11 On Tuesday, August 13, 1974 , in the room 5302 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the Subcommittee on Securities , Chaired by Senator Harrison Williams, gaveled the start of the hearings. Chairman Williams called the witnesses to order to discuss S. 2234 and S. 2683. He introduced the bills : âBoth of these bills are designed to assure public disclosure of the securities holdi ngs and large equity transactions of institutional investors. Disclosure by institutional investors of their securities dealings is now generally recognized as being in the best interest of 9 See 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1) , emphasis added. 10 See Institutional Investor Study Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Summary Volume (March 10, 1971), at v ., available at https://bit.ly/348Wuuh . 11 Chairman Garrett was accompanied to the hearing by Harvey L. Pitt, Executive Assistant to the Chairman; Lee A. Pickard, Director, Division of Market Regulation; Allan S. Mostoff, Director, Division of Investment Management Regulation ; Francis R. Snodgrass, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation; and Martin E. Lybecker, Attorney in the Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Investment Management Regulation . Securities and Exchange Commission Page 4 the fair and orderly operation of the markets. This recognition i s apparent in the bipartisan support for these two bills. S. 2234 was introduced in July of last year by Senators Brooke, McIntyre, Proxmire, Tower, and me. S. 2683 was drafted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and introduced by Senators Brooke, Tower, and me at the SEC's request .â12 The two bills âagain , one drafted by Chairman Williams and Senators Brooke, McIntyre, Proxmire, and Tower, and the other drafted by the SEC itself âpursued similar pro -transparency policies but , among other difference s, had significantly different threshold levels. The bill drafted by the Senators (S.2234) set the threshold at $10,000,000 (ten million dollars) for in stitutional investors, and $5,000,000 (five million dollars) for âany broker, dealer or exchange member with any trading or investment account â that would be subject to disclosure requirements.13 Whereas the SEC -drafted bill (S.2683) excluded brokers and set the threshold to âat least $100 million, or such other amount not less than $10 mill ion as the Commission may by rule determine having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets .â14 Note here that the âor such other amountâ language is replaced with âor such lesser amoun tâ in the final, enacted legislation passed by both chambers . At the same hearing, Chairman Garrett discussed the di fferent thresholds , explaining that while he , as the Chairman of the SEC, prefers the SEC -drafted version (setting the threshold at $100 million in contrast with the Senate -drafted version which set the threshold at $10 million ), he nonetheless stat ed that that threshold is a starting point and âif we should later discover that we need to expand our database for our own purposes or for the information of the public, we would have the authority to do so .â15 Note that his use of âexpand our databaseâ meant requiring the disclosure of holdings by more institutional investors by lowering the triggering threshold from $100 million. In othe r words, Chairman Garrett testified that the Commission sympathizes with the Senatorsâ policy goals of requiring the disclosure of 13F information by many more institutional investors (which would have been accomplished by setting the threshold at $10 million) but requested to have flexibility in gradually lowering the threshold from $100 million , as needed. Chairman Garrett was not alone in foreseeing the possibility of requiring the disclosure of 13F information from more institutional investors ( i.e. those that hold less than $100 million in securities) . His c olleague, Commissioner Philip Loomis and Commissionâs staff also anticipated that as the 13F information proves its usefulness, the Commission may require the disclosure from more institutional investors. At a September 13, 1974 , hearing before the House Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance, Commissioner Loomis âreferring to the House companion bill (H.R.13986) to the SEC - drafted S. 2683 âdiscussed the $100 million threshold echoing the words of Chairman Garrett and 12 See Institutional Investors Full Disclosure Act (S.2234 and S.2683) , Hea rings Before Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs , United States Senate, 93rd Congress, 2nd Session (August 13 -14, 1974) , p.1, available at https://bit.ly/3kZxFI1 (âSenate H earingâ) . 13 See Senate Hearing , p.4. 14 See Senate Hearing , p.11. 15 See Chairman Garrettâs testimony, Senate Hearing , pp.21 -22. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 5 said, âif we should later discover that we need to expand our data base for our own purposes or for the information of the public, we would have the authority to do so, within specified limitations. â16 During the same hearing , the following exchange t ook place between the Sub committee âs staff Mr. Charles Curtis and Commissioner Loomis: Mr. Curtis: You indicate on [page 8 of your testimony] or at least create t he impres sion that additional persons will be called upon for reports only if the Commission should later discover that it needs to expand this data base. It is a suggestion to me that the Commission does not intend to set that portfolio level at a lesser amount, although the statute would authorize you to take it down to a $10 million trigger. Is that a correct impression from your comments? Mr. Loo mis: I believe that is correct. I think we will start with the $100 million which will sweep in by no means t he whole population but the majority or a substantial majority of the amounts of holdings involved. Then, if we discover as a result of experience we need to go further, we will. To start, we wouldn't want to expand the job before we begin it.17 Later, in another exchange between Mr. Curtis and Commissioner Loomis, Mr. Curtis re - affirms the Committee âs understanding that were the Commission to change the thresholds that trigger reporting, the Commission would only go in the direction that expands the database and increases the number of reporters. In th e exchange , Mr. Curtis asks to Commissioner Loomis , âYou have already indicated that the Commission's cur rent intention is to leave the program operative at the $100 million portfolio level depending on a subsequent determination as to whether the data base needs to be expande d. Has the Commission made a similar determination in estimating whether it will require these re ports at more frequent intervals than a quarterly basis, or has there been any determination as to what will be the frequency of reporting called for? â To which, Mr. Loomis responds, âI think we would star t with a quarterly basis and see what we get and find out whether some of it should be provided more often, depending on the nature of it. â18 In this hearing Finally , as further indication that th e $100 million threshold could only change in the direction that increases the number of institutional invest ors that must disclose 13F information , Commissioner Loomis submitte d for the House Subcommittee hearing a Memorandum prepared by the Commission âs staff that , among other analysis , includ ed the following statement : âThe Commission would be given rule -making authority to reduce the $100 million test, but in no case to an amount les s than $10 million, having given reasonable consideration to the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the fair and equitable 16 See Institutional Disclosure And Sales of Investment Company Advisers (H.R.10 570 and H.R.13986), Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives , 93rd Congress, 2nd Session (September 13, 1974) , p.27, available at https://bit.ly/3cFwef1 (âHouse Hearing â). 17 See House Hearing , p.44 18 See House Hearing , pp.44-45. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 6 treatment of affected persons .â19 Neither in this staff memo nor in the rest of the Senate or House hearings, t here is any indication by Members of Congress (or their staff) or Commissioner s (or Commis sion staff) that the Commission is authorized to raise the reporting threshold above $ 100 million. To sum -up: Congres sional managers of the 1 3F disclosure bills ; their staff ; SEC Chairman and at least one other Commissioner , and, finally ; SEC staff , all unders tood that the $100 million is a starting point, and should that threshold undergo any changes, the only direction the Commission is authorized to go is the one that increases the number of reporters . Given this history, and the fact that the Senate wanted to set the threshold at $10 million (ten million) while the Commission requested $100 million ( hundred million) it is no surprise that during the Conference that reconciled ma ny differences among multiple other bills that comprised the Securities Act Amendments of 1975 , the operative lang uage for the Section 13(f) threshold changed f rom the (SEC -preferred) âat least $100 million, or such other amount not less than $10 million as the Commission may â¦â to âat least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commissio n, by rule, may determine â¦.â This latter language became the law and has remained unchanged since 1975. The Commission is Misreading and Mis representing the Exemptive Authority As noted above, in addition to the Senate Report language ,20 the Commission in the Release also cites the general exemptive authority under Section 13(f)(3) thatâin the view of the Commission âgrants the Commission authorit y to exempt nearly 90% of current institutional investors from the 1 3F disclosures. Given the legislative and regulatory history laid out in the preceding pages o f this letter, it is preposter ous to suggest that Congress passed a law requiring disclosure of certain information from (then) over three hundred entities21 but somehow also authorized the Commission to cut that number down to 30, should the Commission feel like it. The legislative history supports our contention and disagree s with the Commission âs current reading of the 1 3(f)(3) exemptive autho rity. At the August 13, 1974 , Senate hearing noted above, Senator Wallace Benne tt had the following exchange with SEC Chairman Garrett : âSenator Bennett: It has been suggested that accounts over which a bank has no investment discretion, such as the custodial accounts, should be exempt from reporting. Do you have any comment? Mr. Garrett: If it has no investment authority or responsibility and gives no investment advice, then I would say yes. â22 19 See House Hearing , p.29. 20 See fn. 8, supra. 21 See, for example, House Hearing, p.44, noting that the disclosure requireme nts would apply to 300 separate entities. 22 See Senate Hearing, p.39. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 7 These and similar underst anding of the exemptive authority âthat limits the use of such authority to particular facts and circumstances âwere also expressed by various industry representatives over the course of the two days of the Senate hearings .23 At the September 1 3, 1974, House hearing noted above, the Commission âs staff âin their memorandum that analyzed the differences between the S .2683 ( i.e., SEC-drafted bill) and the H.R.13986 âexplained the need for the exemptive authority and the kinds of circumstances under which such authority may be used. The Commission memorandum reads : âH.R. 13986 pro vides exemptive authority to the Commission with respect to persons defined as investment managers as a class. S. 2683 would provide such exemptive authority over any investment manager, any security, any class of investment managers or any class of securities. The omission in H.R. 13986 of exemptive authority over any individual manager, any security or any class of securities may raise awkward problems. One of the potential problems which is not precisely foresee able is th at, since the security holdings reporting provisions are drafted broadly in an effort to include all securities holdings, it is quite possible that certain securities holdings may be of little or no interest to the Commission and to the public, and the Com mission may wish to delete such securities from the holdings reporting provisions. For example, it may be desirable to exempt the securities of foreign issuers held by foreign institutions. Therefore, it would be desirable to change that exemptive authorit y to include authority ever any investment man ager, any security, or any class of securities. â24 Nothing else in th e legislation and regulato ry history we have examined suggest that Congress or th e Commission expected or unders tood tha t the Section 13f (3) exemptive authority would permit the Commission to reduce the number o f entities that disclose 13F in formation by nearly 90%. *** Other than a half-a-sentence mention ing of the Commissionâs 1968 -71 study, the Release omits the entire legislative and regulatory history recounted above. This omission of material facts and analys es creates a misimpression of the Commission âs authority to change the threshold , which amounts to a regulatory malpractice . Conclusion The Co mmission must withdraw this patently anti -transparency and anti -investor Proposal. Given t he legislative and regulatory backdrop recounted above , we reiterate that the Commission 23 See Senate Hearing, p. 68; p.70; p.75; p.78; p.202, etc. 24 See Commission âs memorandum reproduced in the House Hearing, p. 30 (emphasis added) . Securities and Exchange Commission Page 8 lacks the authority to raise the threshold 35 -fold and the Commission would be abusing the exemptive authority found under Section 13 (f)(3) if it do es so .

How could you even be considering reducing disclosures by large investors with the potential to move markets? Compliance costs to file a 13F are negligible to a $100 million fund, which is the minimum size required to report. 13F's are a critical source of information to market participants on the holdings of the largest investment managers that provide insight impacting my individual portfolios. They do not put funds at any disadvantage given the 45 day period that elapses before filing 13-F's after the end of each quarter. Instead, you are seeking to remove important information from individual investors and academics at a time when you should be seeking to improve transparency to protect individual investors. I strongly encourage you to keep the current rules intact and not adopt rules that reduce disclosures by key market participants."

         "Sep. 30, 2020 Subject: File No. S7-08-20 From: Sumit Gupta -------------------------- September 30, 2020 I am opposed to the proposed change, and instead favor of keeping the current $100M rule for 13F reporting. As an individual investor managing and investing money for my family, I'm in favor of more transparency rather than less. I think the argument that people copy cat fund positions from 13F is unfair. Most fundamentally based managers have plenty of time to establish a position before it gets reported in a 13F. Most of these managers are not buying and selling within months, but instead they would like to hold for years ideally. In fact more eyeballs on these stocks instead helps these stocks get more interest which eventually translates into more flows into these stocks and thus better price discovery. All of this is especially true for micro, nano, smaller and mid cap companies. If certain funds are trading in and out on a less than quarterly time-frame, then their 13Fs are useless to the long term investor and the argument about copycatting is invalid. Passive investing flows into market cap weighted ETFs, also flows into the SPX and NDX from 401ks have started to distort the market where everyone needs to own the same large cap stocks and FAANG stocks. Its just a big crowded trade, and if you happen to be a popular large cap then you keep getting bought by these flows. By giving access to 13F for smaller funds which actually do real fundamental research and even activism, it allows for more efficient price discovery for micro/smaller/mid cap public companies. Fund managers and individual investors can see what their favorite fund managers are buying which allows for greater price discovery. It also helps the individual investor direct their energies and time to research certain stocks even further. It helps the fund manager if the broader market also participates and starts buying these stocks. That is why so many fund managers are pitching stocks at investment conferences or in their quarterly fund letters. Another benefit is skin-in-the-game and alignment. Many fund managers are releasing quarterly letters talking about and pitching their investment thesis on different stocks. Same thing for many public platforms like Twitter Seeking Alpha, Stocktwits and plenty of stock forums where fund managers discuss investment ideas frequently. I would like to confirm by checking a 13F whether or not what they discussing is real or not. For an individual investor checking 13Fs is the only way for me to verify what managers are saying is in their portfolio. In the end I think the proposed rule will have the opposite consequence of what is actually intended and might make smaller fund managers struggle even more as no one even buys the same stocks as them. So please keep 13F disclosure as it is at $100M. If the idea is to create less compliance burden/cost for fund managers then I think a better way is to modernize the SEC website so the online forms could be easily filled/saved instead. The focus should be on improving the digital/IT infrastructure to make it easier for fund managers rather than increasing the AUM threshold. Please aspire towards more transparency in markets rather the less."

My reasons are as follows: Filing costs to managers are negligible and in my experience much lower than those described in the proposal; âFront-runningâ based on 13F filings is largely a non-issue as the information is 45-days old at best, which leaves enough time to all but the biggest managers to complete their trades; Due diligence and transparency would be dramatically reduced: 13Fs provide a very useful tool when researching and monitoring investment managers. The proposal would reduce the numbers of managers filing by about 90% according to current estimates; Companies would see much reduced information about their shareholder base, particularly smaller companies.

         "1 September 8, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Vista Outdoor (NYSE: VSTO), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets, h eadquartered in of Anoka, Minnesota , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commissionâs proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SECâs proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company. The proposed rule, if enacted, would result in less effective engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and materially weaken the robustness and quality of our trading surveillance data, which has proven invaluable to us to better understand and work with our shareholder bas e. 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company . While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data we have illustrating âstreet nameâ investors buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research /triangulation efforts . While Vista Out door has the scale to support investments in surveillance data, many small -cap issuers are unable to make the same level of commitment, placing even greater reliance on the completeness and transparency of 13F filings to support effective investor engagement programs . We do not believe the Commission has properly considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and its impact on our ability to effectively engage with our investors throughout the y ear. Operating at an approximate $1.13B market cap , we are particularly concerned at how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify and monitor changes in ownership amongst our largest shareholders. Based on our current shareholder base, we estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would result in an overall 23% loss of transparency based on total shares outstanding. On an absolute basis, approximately 78 out of 210 fil ers currently disclosing ownership of Vista 2 Outdoor common stock would be exempt from filings under the proposal , effectively reducing visibility by approximately 37% of total filers. See below table for details as reference. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency At Vista Outdoor, we take shareholder engagement very seriously , and believe that receiving regular feedback from our largest shareholders is key to our long -term success . Our company leverages 13F data to allocate scarce CEO/CFO and other senior executive time to investor meetings . We would lose visibility in to the ownership of over 21% of our total shares outstanding under the Commissionâs proposal . Since it is not feasible for us to grant every request; our IR engagement program must g ive priority to our largest shareholders and also towards targeting/outreach initiatives underway . If the Commissionâs proposed changes are adopted, our ability to identify and prioritize smaller holders of our common stoc k for engagement would be significantly reduced. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our companyâs ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholde rs and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively identify, engage with and attract stable, long -term investors in our common stock. By hindering this effort, the Commissionâs proposal could potentially deprive us of the perspective and stability that new long-term investors bring to the table, as well as make it more difficult for us to raise growth capital should we need to do so in the future. As required by the agencyâs mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commissionâs proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies âprovide as much information as is practicableâ to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the glob al COVID -19 pandemic.1 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our 1 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, âThe SECâs three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes o n particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure â providing the public with the information necessary to 3 need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of short -term share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions . The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short -term-oriented fund managers . Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls u nder the $3.5 billion threshold is building a position in our common stock until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. While we agree that SEC should modernize its own ership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impact s of this 13F proposal on our companyâs ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commissionâs inflation -based increase in th e gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,2 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status .3 For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .4 make informed investment decisions â is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . .. We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.â Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, \"The Importance of Disclosure â For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID -19,\" April 8, 2020. 2 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33 - 10332; 34 -80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017). 3 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34 -88365; File No. S7 -06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold fo r exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 4 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance , Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec .gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, 4 Rather than further reduc e 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period .

Raising the $100 million threshold at which investment managers need to disclose their equity holdings to $3.5 billion is a bad idea. Transparency of institutional investor activities is essential for market integrity. 1 All opinions are strictly my own and do not necessarily represent those of Georgetown University or anyone else. Over the years I have served as a Visiting Academic Fellow at the NASD, served on the boards of the EDGX and EDGA exchanges, served as Chair o f the Nasdaq Economic Advisory Board, and performed consulting work for brokerage firms, stock exchanges, market makers, and law firms . Iâve also visited over 75 stock and derivative exchanges around the world. As a finance professor, I practice what I p reach in terms of diversification and own modest holdings in most public companies, including brokers, asset managers, market makers, and exchanges. 2 2. The proposed $3.5 billion threshold amount is too high. Letting billion -dollar hedge funds act in the dark is a bad idea. 3. Dropping nearly 10% of assets from the light of day will harm academic studies of the impact of institutional investors. 4. The SEC should clarify that âholdingsâ includes short positions as well as long positions. 5. Form 13F fil ings should include OTC stocks as they did when Rule 13(f) -1 was first adopted. 6. The Proposing Release overstates SEC authority . The s tatute explicitly states âo r such lesser amount â not âor such other amount.â This was a conscious amendment made to the law during the legislative process to remove the SECâs authority to increase the threshold. 7. Congress amended the authorizing sentence in 13(f) in 2010 and chose to leave the threshold at â$100,000,000 or such lesser amount.â Thus 2010, not 1975 , would be the proper base year for any adjustment. 8. Look for other ways to reduce costs and burdens. Form NPORT -P filers sho uld be exempt because Form 13F is mostly redundant to NPORT -P. Introduction In 1975, Congress passed the National Market System amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.2 Among many other substantial changes, the amendments required institutional investors managing more than $100 million to report their holdings in securities registered with the SEC .3 The SEC implemented this filing requirement with Rule 13(f) -1 that requires such institutional investors to report their equity holdings on Form 13F.4 2 Public Law 94 -29 3 As amended by Dodd -Frank in 2010, Â§13(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 19 34 now reads: Every institutional investment manager which uses the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in the course of its business as an institutional investmen t manager and which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) or otherwise becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of any security of a class described in subsection (d)(1) upon the purchase or sale of a security -based swap that the Commission may define by rule, having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may d etermine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event sh all such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. 4 See SEC Release No. 34 -14852 ,43 FR 26700, June 22,1978. 3 The SEC is proposing to raise the reporting threshold from $100 m illion to $3.5 b illion, a 34,000% increase. This would release approximately 4,500 money managers, each of whom controls over $100 million dollars in assets, from their legal obligation to report to the public what they are doing. These money managers collectively manage over $2.3 trillion in assets, 9.2% of the assets currently reported on Form 13F.5 Transparency is essential to maintaining market integrity. This proposal would let billion -dollar hedge funds avoid disclosure. As reported in Bloomberg, this means that funds run by people such as George Soros and other controversial hedge fund managers would avoid disclosure.6 By reducing transparency for smaller funds, this proposal makes it harder for potential investors to do their due diligence on smaller institutional investors.7 By examining 13F f ilings, potential investors can see whether the actual investment history of a manager is consistent with its marketing material. Eliminating 13F transparency for 4,500 investment managers will also make it harder for potential invest ors to detect fraud b y investment managers .8 Issuers depend upon 13F filings as the only way that they can find out who their street name shareholders are. One small company es timated that 46% of its 13F -disclosed shareholders would avoid disclosure under the proposed rule .9 Issuers state that 13F data are essential for their shareholder engagement.10 The reduction in reporting of institutional positions will also make it harder for analysts to track âcrowded tradesâ in which too many institutions have piled into a single idea.11 Crowded trades often end badly when too many investors run for the exit at the same time, so identifying crowded trades is important for alerting investors of the risk. 5 The Proposing Release can be found at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf 6 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-14/tepper -einhorn -soros -stock -holdings -would -go-dark-in-sec- plan 7 See the comment letter from Sarah Metzgar at Talson Capital Management, https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7415009 -219283.htm 8 See the comment letter from Doron Cohen at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415172 - 219344.htm 9 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7644287 -222350.pdf 10 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7741257 -223138.pdf 11 See https:// www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could -shroud -hedge - fund-crowding 4 13F filings provide great amounts of useful information . For example, 13F data are now demonstrating which institutional investors are investing in bitcoin, data that may soon disapp ear if the proposed rule is adopted.12 The instantaneous outpouring of opposition to this proposal expressed in the comment letters is strong evidence that the public interest is to increase, not decrease, transparency into the activities of institutional investors. As one commentator has al ready pointed out: âWhen Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of securities markets. Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets. If only they had the same confidence in US regulators. â13 13F filings are not unduly burdensome on smaller asset managers. All 13F requires is a list of assets. Such lists are at the fingertips of every asset manager, no matter how large or small. As RockCreek Group noted, âHowever, it is worth pointing out that over the nearly two decades that we have been in existence, not once has any of our smaller managers raised the 13F filing requirements as burdensome with the potential to stifle future growth â including new managers with as little as $250 million under management.â14 The proposed threshold is too high and the logic is nonsensical. The real question is âAt what size threshold do the benefits to society of better disclosure outweigh the costs ?â The Proposing R elease makes no attempt to figure this out. There is some bleating that disclosing holdings is somehow costly to managers, as well as some conveniently expanded estimates of compliance costs. Let us examine these two factors. First, the Proposing Release states that disclosure may be costly to the funds as other investors could guess what the fund would do in the future and âfront runâ them, pushing up the cost of doing trades in 12 https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/08/06/valuable -sec-data-on-20-institutional -bitcoin - investors -could -soon -disappear 13 Comment letter of Daniel Farao, https ://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415705 -219424.htm 14 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7787361 -223531.pdf 5 the future. The proposition that the information revealed in Form 13F harms filers due to front running is quite weak. The 45-day time lag between the end of the quarter and the required filing date is more than enough time to complete most institutional trades , elimin ating the risk of front running . Even large orders relative to the average daily volume can usually be executed within a week or two, so 45 days is more than enough time for a manager to complete a trade. The SEC could easily reduce this window without causing substantial harm to filers. As documented in Christoff ersen et al (2018), managers make use of the 45 day lag and wait an average of 37 days to file.15 Their paper documents that smaller funds actually take less time to file than larger funds, in dicating that they may be less concerned about front running or copycatting than large r funds. Indeed, the notion that a managerâs forthcoming trades are so large that they could move the market is a strong argument that the manager is large enough that disclosure should be required. The whole reason for the various Â§13 disclosure requirements stem s from the large power of institutional investors and the need for transparency to spotlight any abuses. Moreover, if a manager does believe that they will be harmed by the disclosure, there is a process for requesting confidential treatment. Second, t he notion that Form 13F is burdensome is a critique o f its implementation by the SEC. In theory, complying with the Â§13(f) disclosure requirements should be simple. Every asset manager must produce position reports for its internal purposes including ris k management, as well as position reports for its investors. This can usually be done at the touch of a button. Often these reports can be generated in real -time during the trading day . There is no reason why submitting such a report to the SEC as well as to fund management should be a difficult or burdensome endeavor. Manager s already have the data at their fingertips. The only thing that could be burdensome is the SECâs form. If compliance costs are an issue, the SEC should examine ways of streamlin ing the filing process. The logic in the proposing release is that the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies has purportedly grown by a factor of approximately 35 since 1975, so the threshold should increase by the same amount. That mak es no sense. The real question is âHow big does a manager have to be before their trading can have a major impact on the market?â Institutional investors with $100 million under management can still have a major impact on companies with their trading, es pecially on smaller and midcap companies. 15 This excellent paper was cited in the Proposing Release. See Susan E.K. Christoffersen, Erfan Danesh, and David Musto, Why Do Institutions Delay Their Shareholdings? Evidence from Form 13F , (Working Paper, June 11, 2018) (âChristoffersen, Danesh and Mus toâ), available at https://www.bwl.uni - mannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/bwl/Area_Finance/Finance_Area_Seminar/HWS2018/Christoffersen_Paper.pdf It should be noted that this paper does not document any quantitative harm from front running or copycatting, only t hat managers make use of the time available for filing. 6 Dropping almost 10% of assets will harm studies of the impact of institutional investors. 13(f) data are widely used in academic studies on a variety of topics . Such data are essential for empir ical studies that need to control for the extent of institutional ownership. The proposed increase in the threshold, by the SECâs own data, remove from public eye ownership data on almost 9.2 % of the existing data. 16 A brief search of the Social Science Research Netw ork (SSRN) identifies over 1,400 academic papers that refer to 13(f) data.17 A Google Scholar search on âSEC 13(f) institutional holdings â yields âabout 195,000 results.â18 The SEC proposal is out of step with global trends in disclosure. The SEC is proposing to increase the thres hold for disclosure by 34,000%. This ignores the global trend in other countries to decrease, not increase, the disclosure threshold.19 OTC stocks should be included in the list of 13F securities . One thing that puzzles me is why the official list of Section 13F securities leaves out OTC stocks. The statutory definition of the required securities specified in 13(d)(1) includes â any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to section 12 of this title. â Th ere are many companies that are SEC registrants under Section 12 and which should be in the official 13F list but are not , as they are traded OTC and not listed on exchanges . The explanation lies in the obsolete language of SEC Rule 13f -1. Rule 13f -1 specifies that securities âquoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association â should be included on the 13F list.20 This wording goes back to the original promulgation of the rule back in 1978.21 That meant that NASDAQ -listed s ecurities were on the list. In those days, NASDAQ was not an exchange but a registered securities association that provided quotes for the OTC market .22 Thus, the 13F list originally covered virtually all equities traded in the United States, both exchang e-listed and OTC. 16 See the table on page 17 of the Proposing Release. 17 www.ssrn.com 18 https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=SEC+13%28f%29+institutional+holdings&btnG= 19 See Schouten, Michael C., and Mathias M. Siems. \"The evolution of ownership disclosure rules across countries.\" Journal of Corpo rate Law Studies 10.2 (2010): 451 -483. 20 17 CFR Â§ 240.13f -1 21 43 FR 26705 22 At the time, NASDAQ was an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system. Today, Nasdaq is not an acronym and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., i s no longer owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers (now FINRA). 7 Gradually, our markets evolved. Today, Nasdaq is a national stock exchange with high listing standards. Over the years it raised its listing standards multiple times, shedding many companies along the way.23 The over -the-counter marke ts have evolved and now entities such as OTC Markets perform the same function that NASDAQ did in 1978. OTC stocks are now quoted on the OTC Market, which is not a registered securities association. Thus, many OTC -quoted SEC registrants are not included in this list, despite the clear statutory requirement that they should be. The SEC should fix this omission and follow the law. As the original rule had anything quoted on a national securities association, the rule should be updated to include any equ ity security issued a ticker symbol by a registered securities association (i.e. FINRA. ) Here is a suggestion for updating Rule 13(f) -1 with additions underlined and deletions struck out : (c) For purposes of this rule âsection 13(f) securitiesâ shall mean equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of the Act that are admitted to trading on a national securities exchange or have a ticker symbol issued by quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association. Including OTC stocks on the 13F list will bring increased transparency into the ownership of these companies . This will help the issuers in this segment have a better understanding of who their shareholders are, and it will help investors to know who their co -investors are. It will also increase institutional ownership in this segment by highlighting the instit utional ownership of other investors, and thus increase investment in small -cap companies quoted on the OTC market. It is thus in the public interest to increase such transparency into the ownership of OTC -traded companies. Modernizing 13F in this way wi ll simplify the creation of the 13F list: If it has a ticker symbol, itâs on the list and holdings need to be disclosed. This could actually reduce compliance costs. There will be no need to sift through all of the OTC -traded stocks to figure out which ones are or are not on the list. This will also simplify compliance by money managers with an easily understood criteria for the 13F list. While we are on the topic of 13F â¦ 13F filings should include short as well as long holdings . The SECâs current FAQ guidance for Form 13F contain explicit instruction s to NOT report short positions in equities or options.24 This is a mistake that should be corrected. There is no reason the transparency requirements in 13(f) should not apply equally to short as wel l as long holdings. The same public interest concerns about the activities of institutional investors apply equally to the short side as the long side of their holdings. Indeed, given the potential for manipulative short selling , the public interest 23 Most notably in 1990 (56 FR 44108) and 1997 (62 FR 45895) 24 See questions 41 and 43 of the FAQ at https ://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm . 8 conc erns are even stronger for short positions. In addition to price manipulation, short selling can also be used to manipulate corporate governance through âempty votingâ in shareholder votes.25 Better disclosure of short positions would make it easier to detect such behavior, which currently is extremely difficult to detect. It should be noted that the European Union has a lower threshold for reporting short positions than long positions.26 Nevertheless, the Commission has repeatedly turned a deaf ear to the repeated pleas of issuers, exchanges, and investors for better transparency around short selling.27 The SEC should amend its Form 13F FAQ guidance to clarify that holdings includes short holdings as well as long holdings. FAQs generally donât go through the notice and comment process, so this can be done quickly and easily. The SECâs traditional Form 13F guidance i s a mistaken interpretation of the statute as well as of the more recent will of Congress . The statute speaks of âholdingsâ and requires reports for âeach such equity security held.â Given a lack of an official statutory definition of âsecurity held,â it is certainly within the Commissions interpretive power to interpret âholdingsâ as the contents of a portfolio, not just the long positions. This is indeed the common understanding of the phrase. For example, Investopedia defines holding as , âHoldings ar e the contents of an investment portfolio held by an individual or entity, such as a mutual fund or a pension fund.â28 Short positions are clearly part of the contents of a portfolio. Here is another example of how the word âholdâ is commonly understoo d in the financial world. Interactive Brokers regularly sends me a list of insider purchases and sales in securities I hold . Here is an excerpt from a recent email they sent me : 25 A manipulator who wanted to affect the outcom e of a shareholder vote could go long in one account and then hedge the position either by short selling in another account or through derivatives. For example, a bad actor with a large position in one firm, c ould engage in empty voting to disrupt a competitor of tha t firm, such as through blocking a value -enhancing merger. 26 The EU requires short positions greater than 0.1% to be reported to regulators and greater than 0.5% to be reported publicly. See https://www.esma.europa.eu/regulation/trading/short -selling . 27 See for example, various petitions for rulemaking including https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2020/petn4 - 758.pdf , https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2017/petn4 -712.pdf , https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 - 691.pdf , and https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf . It is curious that the Commission has refused to act on these numerous reasonable pleas, while it is engaging in unnecessary and harmful rulemakings like this one. 28 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdings.asp 9 The table provided by Interactive Brokers includes insider purchases and sales in securities in which I hold a short position, not just the securities in which I hold a long position. The SEC should accept that the standard financial usage of the word âholdingsâ includes both long and short posit ions and modify the instructions to Form 13F to explicitly include short positions. Here is yet another example. There is a class of mutual funds known as long -short funds that engage in short selling. Like most mutual funds, most of these mutual fun ds put out fact sheets that provide useful information about the funds. I did a search on mutualfund.com and identified 30 long-short funds with more than $115 million in assets. Of these 30 long-short funds , 23 of them explicitly included short positions as âholding sâ on their fact sheets or on their web sites . None of them posted only long positions as holdings, except for one fund which only posted its largest holdings which all happened to be long. Thus, it is a common usage in financial markets to include short positions as well as long positions when discussing holdings. The SECâs own instructions for Form N -Q also treat short positions as holdings. The SECâs directions to exclude short holdings from Form 13F is even more puzzling given that the instructi ons to Form N -Q (Quarterly Schedule of Portfolio Holdings o f Registered Management Investment Company ) call for the complete schedule of investments.29 Thus, the SEC itself uses the common financial usage of âholdingsâ to refer to both long and short positions. The SEC should be consistent and revise the guidance for Form 13F to explicitly include short positions. 29 https://www.sec.gov/files/formn -q.pdf 10 Option positions equivalent to shor t equity holdings are already included in 13F requirements . Another reason to report short positions is that some short equity exposures are already included in Form 13F. Options are clearly included in the official list of 13F securities.30 Indeed, her e is a sample from t he latest list as of this writing : It is well known from âEuropean Put -Call Parityâ that a long position in a put option has the same payoff and is economically equivalent to the payoff from a combination of shorting the stock and owning a call . It is common sense that , if one type of position is included in the disclosure , then an economically equivalent position should also be included. Thus, short equity positions should be included in 13F filings just as long put options are required. Similarly, short option positions should also be included in the disclosures. Dodd -Frank expanded 13(f), so a reinterpretation is within the recent intent of the law. Congress amended 13(f) in 2010 to include âpurchase or sale of a security -based swap â in defining the assets under management that would be counted for the $100 million threshold. This indicates Congressional thinking that long and short positions, as well as derivatives, should be counted by its use of the words (emphasis added) âpurchase or sale .â Even if the Commissionâs overly narrow interpretation of 13(f) w ere somehow defensible prior to Dodd -Frank, it be came less defensible after Congress added its intention to count long and short swap transactions. The Commission should update the instructions and FAQ to Form 13F as part of its Dodd -Frank housekeeping. 30 https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13f/13flist2020q2.pdf 11 Congress did NOT give the SEC authority to raise the reporting threshold. As Commissioner Lee made clear in her eloquent statement, the enabling statute âprovides no support for increasing the threshold.â31 You should listen to her. She is right. The plain text is clear: Congress set a threshold of âat least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) â. The text does not say âor such other amountâ or âor such greater amount.â When Senator Williams introduced Senate Bill 249 that would become the 1975 amendments that established 13(f) , he stated that the SEC would indeed have authority to raise or lower the limit . In his words, âThe SEC would have rulemaking authority to raise or lower the $100 million jurisdictional amountâ¦â 32 Here are his remarks from the Congressional Record: The original language in S249 did in fact contain the phrase âor such other amount.â Again, here is the submission of the original S249 in the Congressional Record: 31 https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10 32 Congressional Record, January 17, 1975 S437 12 However, the final law that was passed did not include the phrase âor such other amount.â Congressman Staggers â amendment in the H ouse contained the l anguage âsuch lesser amountâ, which was the language chosen for the final law. This amendment process is clear evidence that Congress intentionally and thoughtfully chose whether or not to give the SEC statutory authority to raise the threshold. Congre ss intentionally gave the SEC the authority to lower but not to raise the threshold. It remains to be seen how broadly the exemptive authority found in Â§13(f)(3) and Â§36 (a)(1) applies in this case when Congress clearly decided to withhold authority to increase the threshold . The Commission would have to demonstrate that such â such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. â33 This will be hard to do as this proposal seriously we akens the protection of investors. It is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest. Removing transparency from 90% of the previously required filers with such dubious justification is arbitrary and capricious. The current proposal to inc rease the threshold by a factor of 35 will not withstand a court challenge. A 34,000% increase in the reporting threshold is not in the public interest or consistent with the intent of the section. Indeed, it clearly goes against Congress conscious decision not to give the SEC authority to raise the limit. 33 Securities Exchange Act Â§36(a)(1) 13 Congress chose not change the threshold in 2010. Additional evidence against raising the threshold comes from the fact that Congress effectively reaffirmed the $100 million threshold in 2010 when it passed Dodd -Frank . At that time , Congress amended the exact sentence that contains the threshold to include equity positions based on the purchase or sale of securities based swaps. Given that Congress amended that very sentence in 2010, it stands to reason that Congress considered the entire sentence and consciously chose not to change the â$100,000,000 or such lesser amount â threshold. The correct base year , if any, is 2010, not 1975. Unlike many other areas in Dodd -Frank , Con gress did NOT see fit to add an inflation escalation clause to the threshold . In Dodd -Frank, Congress added several inflation escalation clauses include for the definition of an exempt commercial purchase, SIPC protection, expedited funds availability, Truth in Lending Act, and the qualified client definition.34 Congress could have added an inflation escalation clause when they amended that sentence but chose not to . Once again, Congress examined and edited the sentence establishing the threshold in 2010 . This means that the year 2010 was the year that Congress last examined and approved the $100 million figure. For that reason, the correct base year for any escalation , assuming , contrary to fact , that the SEC has statutory authority to raise the threshold , should be 2010, not 1975. For the record, over this period the CPI rose 17.65 % and the S&P500 155%. This would imply thresholds of $118 or $255 million, respectively. There are better ways to reduce reporting burdens. SEC should examine other means of reducing burdens. In particular, the information on Form 13F is mostly redundant to the material in Form NPORT -P. Exempting all NPORT -P filers would remove from them this redundant filing obligation. The SEC and the data vendors who utilize 13(f) data can easily grab the data off of NPORT -P filings which are in XML. Summary REDUCING TRANPARENCY IS A BAD IDEA . JUST SAY NO. BETTER YET, INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY INCLUDING SHORT HOLDINGS AND OTC STOCKS. We should increase, not decrease, transparency in the market by requiring the reporting of short holdings and by expanding the 13F list to include OTC stocks. 34 See Dodd Frank section s 527, 929H, 1086, 1100E, 418, 14 Respectfully submitted, James J.

Putna m provides inves tment management services to both individ ual investors â primarily through their financial advisors â as well as to institutional investors worldwide. Putnam manages over 100 mutual funds and 60 institutional strategies across a range o f asset cl asses and investment styles. Putnam is a sponsor of four closed -end funds regist ered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. At September 27, 2020 Putnam had $ 1.8 billion in closed -end fund assets under management. Putnam welcomes the opportun ity to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) with comments on the proposal to raise the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institut ional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion (the âProposal â).1 Putnam understands the desire of the SEC to update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by insti tutional investment managers for the first time in 45 years to reflect the change in size and structure of the U.S. equities market since 1975 . How ever, we believe th at the sizeable increase in the reporting thre shold would have a detrimental effect on closed - end fund s and their sponsors by exempting a number of instit utional inve stment managers that are leading closed -end fund activists from reporting ob ligations on F orm 13F. We believ e that Form 13F reports p rovide closed -end f unds with valuable insights into the accumulation of positions in closed -end fund s by activi sts that are below the 5% threshold for reporting on Schedule 13D or 13G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Act â). 1 See Reporting Threshold for Ins titutional Investment Managers , 85 Fed. Reg. 46016 (Jul. 31, 2020), available at (https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf (the â Proposing Release â). 2 The Proposal would amend Rule 13f -1 and Form 13F to raise the reporting thresh old for Form 13F from $100 million to $3.5 billion. In the Pr oposing Relea se, the SEC stated that it determined the adjustment based on the gro wth of the U.S. equities market that occurred between the adoption of section 13(f) in 1975 and December 2018, and that it is designed to reflect proportionally the s ame market value of U.S. equities that $100 mi llion represented in 1975 . We agree with t he concerns expressed by Commissioner Allison Herr en Lee , who dissented on the Proposal. In her statement, Commissioner Lee noted that the Proposal âwould eliminate access to information about discretion ary acco unts managed by more tha n 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets â and that the â[t]he costs of losing transparency are glossed over in brief narrative form and largely discounted â in the Proposing Release . See Statement on the Proposal to Substan tially Reduce 13F Reporting . July 10, 2020. If the Proposal is adopted as proposed , it is estimated that 90% of the institutional investment managers currently subject to Form 13F reporting would no longer be required to report. Based on our review of recen t Form 1 3F filings, many of the leading closed -end fund activist firms would fall significantly below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold and would no longer be required to file Form 13Fs. We have been participating in the eff ort of the Investment Company Institute (the âICIâ) to develop comments on the Proposal and support the recommendation of the ICI in its comment letter not to increase the threshold. We agree with the ICI âs position that Form 13F serves as a useful source of market data that is widely utilized by market partic ipants, members of the public, and the SEC , including with respect to activist accumulations of positions in closed -end fund s, and that the SEC should encourage and support the transparency and accessibility of this data, rath er than limiting it. We agree with the ICIâs observation in its comment letter that the loss of transparency regard ing the iden tity of investors currently provided by Form 1 3F fil ings would not be in the best interest of closed - end funds, their long -term inve stors, or the public generally. If, however, the SEC believes some increase in the threshold is necessary, we support one of two alternatives depending on the size of the increase. If the SEC supports the ICI fallback position that any increase in the th reshold should be based on inflation, as measu red by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) , such an increase would be acceptable . If the SEC elects to maintain its pos ition that a material increase in the reporting thre shold is necessary , we believe that the Proposal shou ld includ e a carveout provisio n mandating a continu ing reporting o bligation for institutional inves tment managers that have instituted a proxy contest or filed a Form 13D within a prescribed look -back period of at least 5 years regardless of whe ther the inves tment manager âs holdings of reportable equity securities is below the revised reporting thresh old. Closed-End Fund Activists Shareh older s have chosen to invest in a closed -end fund in part due to the structural advantages that they offer, including the ability to use leverage through preferred shares , 3 maint ain smaller cash positions and hold mo re ill iquid securities. In addition, m any shareholde rs have invested in closed -end fund s at a discount in order to seek higher returns over time relative to a com parable investment in an open -end fund or other vehicle at net asset value. The SEC acknowledged in its proposing release for the 2018 fund of funds proposal that closed -end fund s have h istorically been the target of proxy contests. See Fund of Funds Arrangements (Release Nos. 33 -10590 , Decembe r 19, 2018 at p. 37 and footnote 95 stating that âSince the mid -1990s, closed -end funds that have traded at a discount t o NA V have been the target of proxy contests initiate d by large investors in th ose funds, including other funds. See, e.g ., Tom Lauricella, Proxy Fight at Closed -End Fund Opens Can of Worms for Industry, The Wall Street Journal (Aug. 9, 2002). â) Closed -end fund activists typically see k a âliquidity event â at or ne ar net asset value, including a conversion of the closed -end fund to an open -end fund , liquid ation of the closed -end fund , or a substantial tender offer. The closed -end fund activist may use var ious tactics to achieve this objective, including shareholder proposa ls mandating that the closed - end fund conduct a substantial tend er offer at or near NAV, the nomination of director candid ates, liquidation of the closed -end fu nd or termination of the management contract with the closed -end fund âs existing investment adviser. The activist seeks short -term arbitrage profits from the diffe rence between the discount price of the closed -end fund âs shares and the price paid in connection with the liquidity e vent. In addition to the cost and burden imposed on closed -end fund s by any related proxy contest, a substantial tender off er resulting from an act ivist sharehol der proposal woul d result in a decrease in the closed -end fundâs siz e and increa se its expense ratio . In order to raise the proceeds to fund the tender offer , the closed -end fu nd may have to sell portfolio securities at sub -optimal pric es. In the case of a convers ion of a closed -end fund to an open -end fund or a liquidation , inves tors would lose the benefit s of an investment in a closed -end fund struc ture. Finally, any narrowin g of the discount in the closed -end fund âs share price that results from the li quidity event may only be temporary . According to the I CI, the number of closed -end fund s available to investor s has declined steadily since 2011. From 2012 through 2017, more closed-end fund s were liquidated, and others converted into open -end mutual funds or exchange -traded funds, than new closed - end funds were launched. See ICI Research Perspective -The Closed End Fund Marke t-2019 (April 2019). Although the c ause of the decline in the number of closed -end fund s is likely due to multiple factors, the prevalence of closed -end fund activists and the p ursuit of strategies , including open -ending closed -end fund s and liquid ations, has li kely been a contributing facto r to the de cline, reducing the availab ility for retail inv estors of a product structure with unique advantages. Reporting Threshold For the reasons outline d in this letter , we do not support an increase in the Form 1 3F reporting threshold. If, however, the SEC believe s some increase in the threshold is necessary, we support one of tw o alternatives depending on the size of the increase. If the SEC supports the ICI âs fallback recommendation that any increase in the threshold would be based on inflation, as measured by t he C onsumer Price Index (CPI) , such an increase would be acceptable. If the SEC elects to maintain its pos ition that a material increase in the 4 reporting thre shold is necessary , we believe t hat any material increase in the reportin g threshold should inclu de a carveout provision that mandate s a continu ing reporting obligation for institu tional inves tment managers that have instituted a prox y contest or filed a Form 13D within a 5-year look-back period regardless of whether the inves tment manager âs holdings of reportable equity securities is below the revised reporting thresh old. This carveout provision would ensure continued transparency regarding a ccumulations of posit ions in closed -end fund s that are below the 5% reporting threshold on Schedule 13D or 13G.2 This carveout would not block initiative s by closed -end fund activists but s imply provide the closed -end fund and its board of t rustees and sponsor with continued transparency regarding accumul ations of positions by activists in the closed -end fun d that are below the Sc hedule 13D or Schedule 13G reporting thresholds. This transparency would facilitate th e ability of the closed -end fund and its board of tr ustees to evaluate changes in the closed -end fund shareholder base and consider potential action s to respond to the closed -end fund activist posit ion that are in the best interest of the closed -end fund âs long - term shareho lders, including to consider changes to the fund âs governing documents or other measures to protect the closed -end fund against ac tivist invest ors or to aid the board in assessing the likelihood that a proposal will be successful . Finally, the transparen cy provided by Schedule 13F reporting co uld facilitate timely communica tion with the closed -end fund activist to discuss potential c oncerns r elating to the closed -end fund âs discount or performance. A continued reporting obligation for firms that have ins tituted a proxy contest is appropriate given that the conduct of a proxy contest is a ha llmark of activism. The proposed carveout mandating a continued reporting obligation for Schedule 13D filers as opposed to S chedule 13G filers would address closed -end fund activists who have accumula ted sh are positions in an issuer in order to change or in fluence co ntrol of the closed -end fund . Under S ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act , any perso n who indirectly or directly becomes the beneficial owner of more than 5% of an issuerâs equity securities registered under Sec tion 12 of the Exchange Act must file wi th th e SEC a Schedule 13D within 10 days after the acquisition . However, there are exempt ions that permit a pe rson may be able to file the more abbreviated Schedule 13G in lieu of filing Schedule 13D. One such exempt ion applies to an âinstitutional investo râ, which requir es that the person has ac quire d the securities in the ordinary course o f business and not with the purpose or effe ct of changing or influencing the control of the issuer . We be lieve that such a carveout would preserve vital transparency that exists today with respec t to accumulati ons o f position s in closed -end fund s by activists . 2 We ackno wledge that certain CEF activists operate through funds regist ered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are consequent ly subject to portfolio holdings reporting obligations other than pursuant to Section 13 of the Ex change Act. However, prominent CEF activists accumulate posi tions in CEFs throu gh vehicles and accounts other than registered 1940 Act fun ds. 5 Sincerely, Robert L.

(NYSE: FBC), a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Troy, MI, we appr eciate the opportunity to com ment on the SECâs proposed amendments to the reporting thr eshold for 13F reports by instit utional investment managers (the âProposalâ). We believe that is c rucial to preserve the ability for issuers and investors to maintain access to the many bene fits that 13F reporting provide s and, in principle, support the intent to update and modernize th e requirements. However, we be lieve the proposal is narrowly focused and one-sided, at the expe nse of small and mid-cap issu ers in particular, and limits transparency and the ability to connect with investors. As a re sult, we are writing to express our strong opposition to the Proposal. We believe the Proposal, which would eliminate approximately 89 percent of 13F filings, would result in a significant loss of m arket transparency to our comp any and other publicly traded companies in the United States . If enacted, it would impair our ability to identify and engage with existing shareholders, impede our ability to attract new l ong-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist investors. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership infor mation available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. W hile 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which âstreet nameâ investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. The Proposal would cause us and ot her publicly traded companies to need to hire stock surveillance firms who woul d undoubtedly have to find other, hi gher cost mechanisms to identify investors since they would not be able to obtain sufficient dat a from 13F reporting. We do not believe that the Commi ssion has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company, and the many other small and mid-c ap companies, and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout th e year. As a company with a $1.6 2 billion market capitaliz ation, we are particularly concerned ab out how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our a bility to identify our most acti ve shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimat e that the proposed increase i n the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 26 of our current top 10 0 investors to evade disclo sure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disc lose shares held, 60 percent of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably e ach quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshol d that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allo cate the limited time of our s enior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We attempt to give priority to not only our largest i nvestors and fund managers bu t also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interes ted in increasing their holdin gs in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F thr eshold, we would not have visib ility into this important group which would impose a severe limitation on our ability to engage our shareholders. Negative Impact on Liquidity of Shares The loss of 13F data also would impede our companyâs ability to attract new long-term active institutional investors. This is particularly important for our company as our largest shareholderâformerly a majority shareholderâhas executed multip le secondary offerings the past 24 months. Like many other issuers, we use the 13F filing s to identify potential shareholders (such as those w ho have invested in similar compan ies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach effo rts to prospective investors. This analysis has been critical for our company in identifying those ta rgets that are best position ed to backfill the position our largest shareholder used to hol d. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying (an d selling) our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to target and compe te for investors. As required by the agencyâs mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact proceeding with this rulemakin g will have on companies with large shareholders that are actively divesting positions. Increased Risk of Activism The Commissionâs proposal to si gnificantly reduce 13F disclosur es also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and ot her public companies âprovide as much information as is practicableâ to investors amid t he market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 1 According to Edelmanâs financial communications practice group , 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, âSEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,â July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo. com/news/sec-proposed- rule-change-step-193708183.html . 3 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for g reater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even great er during these uncertain times , when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investor s who would be exempt from repor ting their positions, thus âgaming the systemâ and using the increased lack of transparenc y for their benefit and not that of our companyâs long-term shareholders. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 bill ion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure thr eshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Withdraw proposal and pursue other 13F reforms While we agree that SEC should mod ernize its ownership disclosu re rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our companyâs ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long- term investors, and detect poten tial activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 3 5-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with t he incremental approach the S EC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rul es, such as the Commissionâs in flation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,3 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large acce lerated filer status,4 and the proposed updates to SECâs rules on shareholder resolutions.5 Inflation during the time period of 1975 to 2020 would be less than a 5-fold increase. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director Willi am Hinman observed, âThe SECâs three-part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital format ion, and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure â provi ding the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions â is fundamental to furtheri ng each aspect of our mission. . .. We urge companies to provide as much inf ormation as is practicable rega rding their current financia l and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.â Chair man Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, \"The Importance of Disclosure â For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID-19,\" April 8, 2020. 3 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Tit les I and II of the JO BS Act, Release Nos. 33- 10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-16 (March 31, 2017). 4 Accelerated Filer and Large A ccelerated Filer Definitions, Rel ease No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the thr eshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated file r status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 5 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exch ange Act Rule 14a-8, File No: S7-23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increase the minimum holdi ng requirement for shareholder resolutions from 4 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withd raw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulem aking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Ins titute, the NYSE Group, the Soci ety for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.6 Rather than reduce 13F transp arency, we urge the SEC to promo te more timely and complete disclosure by suppor ting monthly reporting, requir ing the public disclosure of short positions, and shortening the 45-day reporting period.

We are firm believers in the power of disclosure, as we have seen our own markets transform over the past several decades from a paper -based system where company disclosure and pricing information was available only on an intermittent basis to a select few âin- the-know,â to the vibrant, data- driven elec tronic trading market of today. While we support the Proposalâs overarching goal of moderniz ing the 13F reporting regime , we join many other s in expressing our concern that the Proposal would do a great disservice to our U.S. capital markets by decreasing the amount of valuable information available to investors. Rather than further restricting 13F reporting requirements, we believe these obligations should be extended to apply to all publicly traded equites â including those traded on OTC markets . Share ownership d isclosure by institutional investment managers and other powerful market participants is an essential component of fair and efficient markets , as it allows public companies and their investors to understand who holds their securities .

The Commission should not only maintain or lower the monetary threshold for 13F reporting, but should also revise the definition of â13(f) securitiesâ to incl ude OTC -traded stocks. Currently, Rule 13f -1(c) defines âsec tion 13(f) securitiesâ (those that trigger Form 13F reports) as including all equity securities traded on an exchange or â quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities assoc iation â, which is a reference to the OTC Bulletin Board (or âOTCBBâ) operated by FINRA. Over the past ten years, trading activity in OTC equity securities has moved entirely from OTCBB to our markets . As of September 2020, there was not a single security quoted on the OTCBB. In fact, o n September 24, 2020, FINRA filed a proposed rule change seeking to cease operat ion of the OTCBB.4 Therefore, due simply to an outdated reference, the rule unintentionally excludes over 11,000 securities traded on our OTC Link ATS from 13F reporting requirements â including many of the worldâs largest multinational companies such as Adidas, Heineken and Roche that choose to have their ADRs trade on these markets rather than an exchange. The Proposal âs effect of limiting disclosure obligations is also inconsistent with the Commiss ionâs other efforts to increase transparency in our public markets. For example , the Commission recent ly overhaul ed Exchange Act Rule 15c2- 11 to require current public disclosure from all OTC -traded companies in order for brokers to publish quotations in these securities . As noted by Chairman Jay Clayton in an interview concerning the Rule 15c2 -11 amendments , â[t]he bedrock of our federal securities laws is transparencyâ .5 We are concerned the Proposal would limit, rather than encourage, disclosure and ultimately exacerbate the existing informational asymmetries between large, powerful institutional investors and smaller firms and retail investors . In 2013, we submitted comments on a 13F rulemaking petition, requesting that the Commission expand the scope of 13F reporting to include OTC equity securities traded on the OTCQX, 3 Exchange Act Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5, 1979), 44 FR 3033, at 3033- 3034 (the â1979 Adopting Releaseâ). 4 SR-FINRA -2020- 031, available at: https://www.finra.org/sites/d efault/files/2020- 09/SR -FINRA -2020- 031.pdf 5 Alexander Osipovich , SEC Bolsters Safeguards Against Penny -Stock Fraud, WSJ (Sept. 16, 2020), available at: https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec -bolsters -safeguards -against -penny -stock- fraud- 11600294607 .

As an investor relations professional, I rely on Form 13F filings as critical data in investor communication and to direct shareholder engagement. This rulemaking would exempt 4,500 (89 percent of current 13F filers) from disclosure, including many hedge funds and active money managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. 13F data is critical to IR teams when deciding how to allo cate scarce C -suite time among buy -side investment managers who request a call (or a meeting) with the CEO or CFO. This proposed rule would significantly inhibit issuer -investor engagement, especially by small and mid -cap companies that have a greater per centage of investors who would evade disclosure. The proposal is a puzzling step backward from a Commission that champions disclosure and investor protections. It is troubling that t he SEC did not hold a public meeting or a roundtable or otherwise seek the views of issuers before proposing this rule. Every day I see in the market an urgent need for effective s hare holder engagement . This proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency . I respectfully urge the Commission to reconsider and withdraw this proposal and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of 13F disclosure to improve transparency. Sincerely yours, Bess Gallanis, President Bess Gallanis Inc."

There are absolutely no reasons to make the change, but many reasons to keep the current rules. The SEC and other advocates for investor rights continually talk about the need for increased transparency and accountability for the asset management industry, but this policy change would significantly DECREASE transparency and accountability. I know from personal experience that the reporting requirements are not onerous from a time or cost perspective. The 45 day window for filing ensures that trading information is already stale by the time it is released to the public. It would be a contravention of the SEC's own mission, and its responsibility to tax payers and investors to move forward with this change. Thank you for your consideration."

Business Roundtable members invest nearly $147 billion in research and development. In addition, our companies annually pay $296 billion in dividends to shareholders and generate $488 billion in revenues for small and medium -sized businesses. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules is sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) on July 10, 2020, titled Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 (the âProposing Releaseâ). Business Roundtable understands the Co mmissionâs desire to update the thresholds that require institutional investment managers to report their holdings on Form 13F. For the reasons identified below, however, Business Roundtable opposes the Commissionâs proposed amendments to increase the For m 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion (the âProposalâ) and urges the Commission to table this effort until, and as discussed below, there is an alternative source of information regarding the identities of shareholders of public compa nies to replace that which is currently available as a result of the existing Form 13F reporting requirements. Alternatively, we urge the Commission to take a more measured approach in changing the threshold. THE IMPORTANCE OF FORM 13F INFORMATION FO R MARKET TRANSPARENCY AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The Proposal would drastically reduce information available to the public about the identity of the institutional holders of a public companyâs shares. This significant reduction in market transparency wou ld hamper companiesâ efforts to engage with their shareholders and runs counter to the Commissionâs and Chair Clayton's efforts otherwise to increase transparency in the markets. In order to better understand shareholder needs and what behaviors sharehold ers prioritize, companies need to know who their shareholders are. September 29, 2020 Page 2 A successful shareholder engagement program requires companies to be able to identify their shareholders and proactively engage with them through direct outreach. Yet few sources of this information currently exist. As the Commission itself noted in the Proposing Release, â[t]he data [included in Form 13F] can also assist â¦ corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock.â In a shareholding system primarily comprised of âObjecting Bene ficial Ownersâ (âOBOsâ), there is already limited transparency today. Shareholders are not required to identify themselves as owners of a companyâs shares unless they cross the 5% beneficial owner reporting threshold applicable under Sections 13(d) and 13 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ). This is a very high hurdle and not a practical source of information for shareholder engagement. Our typical member company only has a small handful of shareholders that beneficially own more than 5% of the companyâs outstanding stock. Consequently, our member companies and/or the third -party advisors on whom they rely for shareholder information utilize Form 13F filings to identify, and facilitate meaningful engagement with, a significant number of their shareholders. Such engagement may be particularly important for a company in sharing its rationale and approach to issues of core importance to shareholders. We believe that amending the Form 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would signific antly impair shareholder engagement by triggering a substantial loss of market transparency. This loss of transparency would put small and medium sized institutional holders at a disadvantage from a company -engagement perspective. Form 13F filings serve as the single source of information regarding which âstreet nameâ investors are buying and selling stock each quarter, without which our members would not be able to identify a significant number of their shareholders, particularly smaller to medium sized institutional holders. For example, if companies are able to identify the positions of large asset managers and certain hedge funds, but not the positions of small to medium sized institutional holders, companies will, of necessity, dedicate a disproporti onate amount of time to a limited subset of their shareholders. This subset would not include a potentially important universe of institutional holders for targeted engagement â firms with a more focused portfolio that, while holding only a relatively sma ll number of investments may have sizeable positions in particular companies that would fall below the threshold given their total portfolio size. In this instance, the smaller institutional holder with higher relative exposure to a company may be preclud ed from gaining the same level of access to management that larger assets under management shareholders would have purely based on their disclosures â or lack thereof. We urge the Commission to fully consider the potential impacts of these consequences on investor relations efforts and corresponding shareholder engagement. Finally, we believe the loss of Form 13F data would also impede our membersâ ability to attract new capital from long -term institutional investors. Analyzing quarterly trends such as t he buying and selling of securities as well as broader investment shifts across industries are important in identifying potential pools of capital that would be interested in investing in our membersâ securities. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of visibility into those trends across the broader investment universe would hinder the ability of our member companies to compete for and raise growth capital. Further, shareholders that may be considering an September 29, 2020 Page 3 investment in a public company would be deprived of a source of data that may be relevant to their investment decision. THE IMPORTANCE OF FORM 13F INFORMATION FOR MONITORING SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM In addition to its importance to market transparency and shareholder engagement, companies also use Form 13F data to monitor and assess activist investors in advance of such investors triggering the disclosure requirements under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. Under the Proposal, the loss of this data could impair a companyâs ability to detect a potential activist, delay its response and expose the company and its shareholders to heightened risk. Especially in times of high market volatility , companies need greater, not less, transparency in addressing potential activist investors that could take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies, to the potential detriment of long -term investors. Under th e proposed $3.5 billion threshold, companies would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus enabling activists to use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of long -term shareholders. REQUEST TO TABLE PROPOSED CHANGES AND DEVELOP REFORM THAT ADDRESSES CONCERNS The Commission described the problems faced by public companies and others in identifying company shareholders in its 2010 Concept Release on the U.S. Proxy Sy stem (âProxy Plumbing Concept Releaseâ).1 In the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release, the Commission asked wide - ranging questions about how to approach these problems and received meaningful input through the comment process. For various reasons, the Commiss ion has not yet had an opportunity to act on many of the important questions raised in the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release, including developing a solution to the shareholder identification problem. Business Roundtable appreciates the Commissionâs goals in proposing to update and modernize the Section 13(f) reporting system and to save costs for smaller advisers through that effort. But we believe the costs associated with the loss in transparency and the related constraints on access to capital in an i ncreasingly competitive market would be detrimental to the public capital markets and its investors, particularly without an alternative source of the important information provided through Form 13F. Against this backdrop and for the reasons discussed above, Business Roundtable and its member companies urge the Commission to table the Proposal and move forward with this modernization effort in the future when the needs of all stakeholders in this important area can be addressed concurrently â for examp le through Commission action to address the current 1 Release Nos. 34 -62495; IA -3052; IC -29340; File No. S7 -14-10 (July 14, 2010). September 29, 2020 Page 4 inability of public companies to identify their shareholders, as discussed in the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release. If the Commission determines that it will move forward with the Proposal without a solu tion to the shareholder identification problem, Business Roundtable believes that the Commission should take a more measured approach to the change in threshold. Rather than moving from a $100 million threshold to $3.5 billion â a dramatic increase of 35 -fold â any change should be incremental to allow market participants and the Commission to assess the impact of this loss of transparency. A more measured approach would also be consistent with actions taken by the Commission when modifying thresholds in previous rule amendments, such as the Commissionâs adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,2 the inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth com panies3 and the adjustments to the thresholds for smaller reporting companies.4 CONCLUSION Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the Proposal. We believe regulatory reform efforts around reporting of public company shar eholders are of critical importance, and we look forward to sharing our views with the Commission as you move forward on these initiatives in the future. Thank you for considering our comments and recommendations. We would be happy to discuss these comments or any other matters you believe would be helpful.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549- 1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (SEC Rel. No. 34-89290; File No. S7- 08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: The Investment Adviser Association ( IAA) 1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Commissionâs propos al to raise the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers, eliminate the omission threshold for individual securities, r equir e managers to provide additional identifying information, modernize the structure of data reporting , and a mend the instructions on Form 13F for confidential treatment requests.2 We commend the Commission for its efforts to modernize regulatory requirements that have not be en updated in decades. We support raising the $100 million threshold for Form 13F reporting but recommend a substantially more modest increase that takes into account how the users and uses of Form 13F reports have evolved since the reporting threshold was originally adopted. We make the following recommendations that we believe will be tter balance the goals of transparency and limiting regulatory burdens, especially on smaller advisers : A. The Commission should raise the reporting threshold more mode rately than proposed â from $100 million to $500 million â and should permit voluntary filings under the threshold. 1 The IAA is the largest organization dedicated to advancing the interests of SEC -registered investment advisers. For more than 80 years, the IAA has been advocating for advisers before Congress and U.S. and global regulators, promoting best practices and providing education and resources to empower advisers to effectively serve their clients, the capital markets, and the U.S. economy. The IAAâs member firms manage more than $25 trillion in assets for a wide variety of individual and institutional clients, including pension plans, trusts, mutual funds, private funds, endowments, foundations, and corporations.

Reg. 46016 (proposed July 31 , 2020), https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34- 89290.pdf (Proposal ). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 2 of 8 B. The Commission should not eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F and should consider raising this threshold as part of its review of the reporting threshold every five years . C. The staff should conduct its initial future analysis sooner than five years if it significantly raises the reporting threshold . D. The Commission should not require additional identifying information in Form 13F. It should study on a more holistic basis issues raised by requiring the use of licensed nu mbers in regulations . E. The Commission should not make technical amendments to the well -established rounding conventions or how a securityâs value is reported. F. The Commission should make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13Fâs requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F . Our comments are discussed below. A. The Commission should raise the reporting threshold more moderately than propose d â from $100 million to $500 million â and should permit voluntary filings under the threshold. We agree with the Commission that the current $100 million threshold for Form 13F reporting is outdated and should be raised. We also agree that the threshold is no longer in line with Congressâs original intent to provide transparency into t he concentration of institutional ownership of equities holdings of larger managers that have the potential to significantly affect the securities markets , while limiting the burdens associated with filing the reports to the largest institutional investment managers . 3 Over the intervening years, however, as more and more institutional invest ment managers have been required to file a Form 13F, the ways in which market particip ants have used the information in the reports have evolved beyond looking to them to f ill in the trading information gaps of the large st managers . Market participants, including some of our members , view the reports as providing important public benefits that would be largely eliminated if the Commission were to raise the reporting threshold in the amount proposed. We believe that the Commission would strike a better balance between maintaining fair, open, and orderly markets and reducing burdens on smaller institutional investment managers by raising the threshold to $500 million, rather than the $3.5 billion proposed. 3 According to the Proposal: âThe 1975 Amendments Senate Report reasoned that, by setting the threshold at $100 million, the burdens associated with filing Form 13F would be limited to â the largest institutional investment managers â and, therefore, the new filing requirements could be â implemented rapidly with the least amount of unnecessary costs and burdens on the potential respondents. ââ Proposal at 9 . Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 3 of 8 Today, a very large number of SEC -registered investment advisers must file a Form 1 3F,4 and we believe that most IAA members now file Form 13F reports. The compliance burden of filing these reports is more acute for our smaller members. Our l arger members tend to contract with third -party vendors to assist with Form 13F reporting. For these advisers, technology and other resources ha ve lessened the burdens of Form 13F compared to other regulatory and compliance burdens that they face. O ur smaller members , by contrast, tend to handle the reporting in-house. We understand that the software that many smaller advisers use can be difficult to work with and that m anual effort s are often needed to comb through the data, read and detect errors in HTML files, and reconcile CUSIP numbers that systems do not recognize because they begin with a zero.5 Raising the threshold would provide these smaller advisers with welcome relief . On the other hand, we understand from our members that firms across all sizes greatly value t he data they obtain from Form 13F reports and, even for many smaller advisers, the ability to access that data outweighs their own filing burdens. These firms prioritize preserving as much transparency as possible over raising the Form 13F reporting threshold. For other small advi sers, however, the burdens clearly outweigh the benefits. The benefits provided by Form 13F data have evolved over time and are many . Today, Form 13F information is extremely valuable to a wide array of investment advisers and others . Traditional asset managers, for example, find the information useful in managing actively managed strategies , particularly in the small and mid -cap space. S ponsors to closed- end funds rely on Form 13F reports to monitor activist shareholder activity (before reporting persons reach the beneficial ownership or investment levels that trigger Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G, or Form N-PORT filings) . Form 13F gives more information about the diversity of shareholder ownership than data from these other sources. Exchange- traded funds utilize Form 13F data to help satisfy their regulatory obligations, understand their shareholder base, determine how concentrated ownership is in their shares, and provide educational materials and other services to their shareholders . Some s maller managers also are aided by the visibility into the markets that reporting confers. In addition, when they file Form 13F reports they may benefit from b eing recognized as an investor , which can facilitate research and meetings with current an d prospective issuers , thereby increasing the potential for expanding the firm or asset base. Institutional investors that allocate their capital to investment managers also rely on Form 13F reports as an important part of their due diligence i n tracking those managers . The reports provide more extensive and granular data on specific holdings than these investors might 4 As of December 31, 2018, 5,089 institutional investment managers filed Form 13F holdings reports (Form 13F - HR) and an additional 1,570 managers filed form 13F -NT notice reports. Proposal at 16 and n. 40. We do not have data on how many of these filers are SEC -registered investment advisers but we believe that the number is substantial. 5 The Commission may want to consider facilitating the filing of Form 13F through a system, similar to the Investment Adviser Registration Depository , that does not require the use of HTML files, special software, or the assistance of third -party vendors. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 4 of 8 otherwise receive and help them hold managers accountable as to their actual portfolio holdings. The holdings -level details in these report s provide a better understanding of the portfolio than the more high level information that is included in quarterly letters , for example . Form 13F reports thus help institutional investors identify potential mismatches between a stated strategy and actual investments; concentration levels and potential crowded trades ; liquidity; long -term purchase and sale decisions; shifts in a managerâs portfolio as its AUM expands or contracts; and performance by sectors. Institutional investors often seek out pools managed by small- and mid- sized managers in which to invest. If the filing threshold were raised significantly, these institutional investors would lose an important risk management tool that helps them keep a close watch on the smaller managers that they retain. 6 We strongly believe in transparent markets . We agree that t ransparency contributes to safer and fairer markets and is an important goal. And, as these examples demonstrate, Form 13F reports greatly enhance the transparency and safety of the system as a whole. However, transparency needs to be balanced against other considerations, including whether the compliance burdens on small managers are justified . Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission raise the reporting threshold sufficiently to provide relief to the smallest managers but not so high that managers, investors, and the markets lose the myriad benefits of the data. The Commission asks whether the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion is appropriate and, if another threshold would be more appropriate, what the threshold should be and why .7 While we understand the Commissionâs rationale for proposing $3.5 billion as the new threshold and we recognize that the rationale for a lower threshold is a departure fro m Congressâs original intent, we believe that, given the evolution in how Form 13F reports are used, a lower threshold than that proposed is necessary and appropriate in the public interest , for the protection of investors , and to maintain fair and orderly markets. 8 We recommend, instead, that the Commission revise the threshold to $500 million.9 We believe that an updated threshold of $500 6 As demonstrated by these examples, Form 13F data provide many valuable benefits even with the current 45 -day delay period. While we appreciate that the Commission is proposing changes to the scope of managers required to file reports on Form 13F before considering other potential amendments to the Form (Proposal at 12, n. 28) , we note that we strongly oppose shortening the 45- day delay in Form 13Fâs reporting deadline. This lag time effectively avoids most of our membersâ serious concerns about front running or copying of their investment strategies and we are concerned that s hortening the time would revive those concerns. 7 Proposal at 26 ( Question 1 ). 8 Section 13(f)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that the Commission, in exercising its authority under section 13(f), âdetermine (and so state) that its action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors or to maintain fair and orderly markets.â 9 Given that the IAA represent s a very broad spectrum of investment advisers, we note that some of our members support the C ommission âs proposed threshold of $3.5 billion, while some of our members oppose any increase in the $100 million reporting threshold. Raising the threshold from $100 million to $500 million would approximate the 3.54 percent average annual rate of inflation since 1975. See https://www.inflationtool.com/us -dollar/1975- to-present -value . This increase, while Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 5 of 8 million would preserve many of the benefits of greater transparency into the markets while relieving smaller managers of the compliance burdens related to filing , and that this strikes an appropriate balance.10 We also recommend that, t o accommodate those smaller managers that wish to continue filing Form 13F reports , the Commission permit voluntary filing for institutional investment managers that exercise investment discretion between $100 million and $500 million in Section 13(f) securities . Permitting voluntary filing would allow smaller managers to continue to be recognized as investors, should they so elect, and to receive the benefits they associate with that recognition. B. The Commission should not eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F and should consider raising this threshold as part of its review of the reporting threshold every five years . Form 13F allows, but does not require, a manager to omit holdings below a certain share limit and value limit, i.e., holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amount of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggrega te fair market value ( the âomission threshold â). The Commission is proposing to eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F on the basis that , if the reporting threshold is substantially increased, the omission threshold would no longer be necessary or a ppropriate and th e incremental increase in cost of including securities holdings information below an omission threshold i s likely immaterial. We believe, however, that the Commission is undervaluing the importance of the omission threshold to managers of all sizes. We understand from our members that the omission threshold would continue to provide important relief regardless of the reporting threshold amount . Even large firms rely on this de minimis standard, a s it can be burdensome to identify which of hundreds of small positions are eligible for reporting on Form 13F , regardless of the reporting threshold. In addition, in our view, any marginal benefit to the Commission or the public from disclosure of stock holding s whose absolute values are not of a material size is clearly outweighed by the burdens on managers to identify and report these small positions. We thus request that the Commission maintain an omission threshold for all managers. We further recommend that the Commission consider updating the omission threshold every five years as part of its r eview of the reporting threshold. This would help to ease the reporting burdens of firms of all sizes, account for the effects of inflation, and assist firms whose clients transfer small legacy positions to a new adviser . modest, would strike a compromise by providing relief to over 60 percent of advisers . See Table 1 of the Proposal at 16-17, which shows that 62.6 percent of filers would be below a threshold of $500 million or more. 10 If the Commission nonetheless decides to substantially increase the reporting threshold, and bases the adjustment on market growth, we suggest that the Commission use a five-year average stock market rate of growth to minimize the effects of market fluctuations . Proposal at 26 (Question 4). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 6 of 8 C. The staff should conduct its initial future analysis sooner than fiv e years if it significantly raises the reporting threshold. We fully support the proposal that the staff conduct reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold every five years and, if appropriate, recommend an adjustment to the Commission. However, if the Co mmission raises the reporting threshold significantly higher than a moderate increase such as the one that we recommend, we suggest that the staff consider conducting the first of these reviews sooner than five years after raising the threshold in order to evaluate the impact on the market and market participants of a substantial increase in the threshold . Subsequently, we support conducting these reviews every five years. D. The Commission should not require additional identifying information in Form 13F. It should study on a more holistic basis issues raised by requiring the use of licensed numbers in regulations . We believe that Form 13F File Number s have worked well and do not see the need for filers to provide additional identifying information such as CRD numbers and SEC filing numbers. In addition, CUSIP number s are recognized as a basic and simple way to identify a security. S witching to a n alternat ive identifier would be burdensome and could have the potential for error and we thus recommend that the Commission not replace CUSIP numbers with another identifier at this time. As a general matter, however , we believe that build ing requirements into regulations that subject registrants to ongoing related licensing fees and other obligations raises important policy issues. A s we have previously stated to the Commission, 11 S&P holds the license to CUSIP numbers and has been impos ing increasingly burdensome fees on investment advisers, investors, and others for the acquisition, retention, and use of CUSIP identifiers.12 We understand that S&P has be en contacting investment advisers and others seeking to collect significant licensing fees for the use of CUSIP identifiers regardless of the source or use of such numbers. S&P evidentl y takes the position that even using CUSIP identifiers in a firmâs internal database serves as a basis for a request for licensing fees. Licensing fees appear to range from approximately $10,000 per year for an institutional user to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for unlimited global 11 See Letter from The Bond Dealers of America, the IAA, and the Government Finance Officers Associ ation of the United States and Canada (Sept. 9, 2014), available at https://higherlogicdownload.s 3.amazonaws.com/INVESTMENTADVISER/aa03843e- 7981- 46b2- aa49 - c572f2ddb7e8/UploadedImages/publications/140909cmnt.pdf (expressing deep concerns regarding the operation of the CUSIP system, Commission rules that require the use of CUSIP numbers, and the collect ion of fees by Standard & Poor âs (S&P ) for usage of CUSIPâs standard security identifiers); see also Letter from The Bond Dealers of America, the IAA, and the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (Nov. 10, 2010), available at https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/INVESTMENTADVISER/aa03843e -7981- 46b2- aa49 -c572f2ddb7e8/UploadedImages/publications/101110cmnt.pdf . 12 CUSIP identifiers are assigned to new securities issue s by the CUSIP Service Bureau, which is operated by S&P .

We therefore urge the Commission to initiate a holistic review of S&Pâs licensing practices relating to CUSIP identifiers and consider w hether requiring the use of licensed identification numbers in regulatory filings of all types ( including but not limited to Form 13F) poses potential liability , subjects users to the payment of use fees, or is otherwise problematic. E. The Commission should not make technical amendments to the well -established rounding conventions or how a securityâs value is reported . Because of the operational challenges and costs that implementation would entail, w e request that the Commission not amend Form 13F to requir e all dollar values listed on Form 13F to be rounded to the nearest dollar . For the same reason, we also request that the Commission not remove the requirement that filers omit the â000â when reporting dollar values on Form 13F . We are not aware of data inaccuracies resulting from current reporting requirement s and believe, therefore, that the implementation costs would outweigh any marginal benefit from these changes . 13 F. The C ommission should make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13Fâs requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F. We recommend that the Commission make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13Fâs requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit that the signature of the person signing a report on Form 13F may be retained electronic ally. This would mean that fi lers would no longer be required to retain a manually signed copy of Form 13F. Over 20 years ago, the E - Sign Act 14 authorized the creation of electronic contracts, as well as the use of electronic records relating to such agreements. The E -Sign Act provided uniform national standards for the use of electronic signatures, which have grown in use and importance over the past few years . Having the option to retain an electronic signature would substantially reduce th e burdens of obtaining manual signatures under certain circumstances , such as the current COVID -19 pandemic.15 Our members appreciate the staff âs recognition of the challenges raised by the manual signature requirement and its statement providing relief regarding the authentication document retention requirements to those affected by COVID -19. 16 However, filers are still required to 13 The Commission could consider other amendments to improv e the current reporting regime , such as e xcluding nondiscretionary holdings. 14 See Electronic Signature s in National and Global Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) , Public Law No. 106-229 (June 30, 2000). 15 For example, the Internal Revenue Service recently announced that it wi ll temporarily permit digital signatures on more forms through the end of 2020 to limit in- person contact between employees and taxpayers or their representatives. 16 See Staff Statement Regarding Rule 302(b) of Regulation S -T in Light of COVID -19 Concerns (June 25 , 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/rule -302b- regulation -s-t-covid -19-update . Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 8 of 8 retain a manually signed signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging, or otherwise adopting their signature ; indicate the date and time when the signature was executed ; hold it until offices re -open ; and establish and maintain policies a nd procedures governing this process. This has proven problematic for filers and we believe more expansive, permanent relief is warranted . First, some individuals are not able to print documents when working remotely . Second, due to the extended time many in the industry have been working remotely, there is a risk that manually signed documents may become lost, misplaced, or damaged , or that confidentiality may be compromised . Electronic signatures have the advantages of a time stamp and automa ted document retention. Accordingly, as part of the Commissionâ s initiative to modernize Form 13F, we urge the Commission to eliminate Form 13Fâs requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F. * * * We appreciate the Commissionâs consideration of our comments on the proposed amendments to Form 13F and would be happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful.

ResMed is a pioneer of digital innovative solutions that treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher -quality lives. Our digital health technologies and cloud- connected medical devices transf orm care for people with sleep apnea, COPD, and other chronic diseases. ResMed âs comprehensive out -of-hospital software platforms support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. By enabling better care, we improve quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease, and lower costs for consumers and healthcare systems. More than 12 million patients worldwide are remotely monitored at home with ResMed cloud connected devices and there are m ore than 95 million patient accounts in our out -of-hospital care network. Our aim is to deliver life - changing products and connected health solutions worldwide to people with sleep apnea or other respiratory conditions, and to spread awareness about these conditions and treatments. The SEC âs proposal, under which 89 percent of current filers would no longer submit Form 13F, would deny publicly traded companies such as ResMed vital insight into their ownership and that of other publicly traded companies in the United States . Form 13F data is our only source of data that shows â street nameâ investors buying or selling our shares each quarter âwe cannot obtain this information elsewhere . As a large -cap company valued at approximately $25 billion, we are concerned the proposed new Form 13F filing threshold would impair our abili ty to e ngage with shareholders and manage investor relationships in a way that effectively furthers our business goals , including the development of life -saving healthcare technology . The proposed rule would also impede our ability to target and attract new long -term investors . 1 Securities and Exchange C ommission, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Proposed Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 46,016 (July 31, 2020). ResMed 9001 Spectrum Center Boulevard San Diego CA 92123 USA ResMed.com The information included on the Form 13F enables ResMed to build and maintain relationships with key shareholders as an important element of our business and investor relations strategy . 13F data allows us to identify and p rioritize engagement with investors who are interested in maintaining or increasing their holdings , as well as to target and reach to potential future investors . If the Commission finalizes its proposed reporting threshold of $3.5 billion, we estimate that 52% of our current 13F filers would fall out of scope. Without 13F information regarding who is holding as well as buying and selling our shares , ResMed will be unable to engage effectively with those investors. Our company also uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We use 13F filing information t o help prioritize time with not only our largest investors and fund managers, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are aligned in their long -term interest in our company. If the SEC moves forward with its proposed increase in the 13F thre shold, we would not have visibility into this important group of smaller investors . The information provided by 13F filings cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F filing data as a starting point for their research efforts. Additionally, as a company that seeks to improve patient health outcomes through advancements in medical technology, ResMed must effectively manage relationships with current investors and identify potential new investors to rai se crucial capital. ResMed uses Form 13F data to collect information regarding shareholders that have invested in similar companies and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts. By preventing us from gathering this information for a large porti on of investors , the substantial increase that the Commission proposes to the Form 13F threshold would threaten our ability to effectively access the capital markets and grow our business. Thus, a drastically heightened disclosure threshold could negativel y affect our research and development of groundbreaking medical devices and software. In light of these concerns, we urge the Commission not to finalize its proposed update to the reporting threshold for Form 13F. Instead, the agency should maintain the current threshold of $100 million or pursue a much more modest increase that does not so significantly undermine transparency . Additionally, as opposed to reducing market visibility, we recommend that the Commission consider promoting increased 13F transparency by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutti ng the 45 -day reporting period.

         "S&P Global Market Intelligence Martina Cheung 55 Water Street President New York, NY 10041 September 28, 2020 Submitted Electronically Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34-89290; File Number S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman, I write to address the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs (the âCommissionâsâ) proposed rule to update the 13F reporting requirements for institutional investment managers (âinvestment managersâ) set forth in the above-referenced release (the âProposed Amendmentâ). As a provider of data, tools and insights that help decision makers navigate the global markets, S&P Global Market Intelligence (âMarket Intelligenceâ) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Amendment issued by the Commission on July 10, 2020 and understands the Commissionâs desire to streamline and update polices that have been in place for 45 years. We do, however, have some concerns and would respectfully request the Commission consider the impact of the Proposed Amendment on market transparency, shareholder engagement, and the quality of the data financial markets use every day to make informed decisions. Below, Market Intelligence has identified several issues we would ask you to consider. We agree the Commission should update polices when appropriate in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner, but we are concerned the Proposed Amendment could have unintended consequences for all market participants. IMPACT ON FINANCIAL MARKETS Market Intelligence strives to provide the highest quality data to financial markets for all sectors and participants to use and consider. We believe this transparency is a key element of the worldâs most robust and successful credit markets. As currently laid out, the Proposed Amendment would raise the 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, a 35-times proposed increase in the threshold which would result in substantiality less transparency from 90% of current filers. Without an alternative source of data from nearly 90% of investment managers regarding the identities of shareholders of public companies, the ability to provide timely and relevant data to both shareholders and companies will result in less engagement from both sides. From a market transparency angle, raising the 13F threshold could adversely impact both smaller asset managers and retail investors alike. S&P Global Market Intelligence 55 Water Street New York, NY 10041 In addition, the Proposed Amendment estimates raising the threshold to $3.5 billion would effectively eliminate data from more than 4,500 investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion. Market Intelligence regularly interacts with all sectors of the financial markets. Weâve seen many of these managers, whose reporting requirements would be eliminated under the Proposed Amendment, become more active in engaging with issuers on matters relating to long-term strategy, capital, and other important business decisions. Feedback from our clients also indicates that lack of data from these smaller managers and their ownership levels would impede this process. Investment managers also use 13F data from other peer managers to frequently benchmark themselves as part of the capital raising process. The lack of relevant benchmark data for smaller managers would make it more difficult for these managers to raise capital and would unfairly disadvantage them vs larger managers for whom relevant peer benchmarking data would be easily accessible. Based on our interactions with market participants, we expect shareholders, policymakers, and companies to be more engaged with each other more than ever before. Making transparent who owns public company shares only furthers that conversation. Without a mechanism to identify shareholders, meaningful engagement between both parties is likely to diminish and, in some cases, reduces a firmâs capability to access capital markets in a cost effective manner. Market Intelligence urges the Commission to fully consider the potential impacts of these consequences on investor relations as well. While the Proposed Amendment acknowledges the $3.5 billion threshold would retain disclosure of more than 90% of the value of holdings that are currently reported, weâve interacted and seen many market participants engage with one another who would not fit in this definition, therefore eliminating transparency to important parts of our financial markets. ITEMS TO CONSIDER Based on the above-mentioned concerns about transparency and market engagement, Market Intelligence also suggests the Commission look at a more modest change to the 13F threshold based on the Consumer Price Index. This approach would be consistent with other adjustments government agencies have made, including the Commissionâs accelerated filer status or the inflation-based increase for emerging growth companies. We believe a more incremental change would allow market participants to better assess the impact of less transparency. As mentioned above, the Commission acknowledges that a wide variety of individuals use 13F data, including data providers. We respectfully request that the Commission not only consider the impact on small asset managers but expand the impact analysis to accurately measure the loss of this data on other market participants. As a data provider, we are aware of different types of usage for 13F filings from various market participants that rely on our service to provide them with the best in class information to take decisions with conviction. We recommend looking at the following who are also users of this data and consider the impact on them as well: â¢ the general public, whom 13F data helps create an environment of confidence in the markets; â¢ for investors and fund managers to be able to compare their monthly reports with the 13F data; S&P Global Market Intelligence 55 Water Street New York, NY 10041 â¢ for investors and fund managers to better evaluate their existing advisory relationship and/or identify other investment advisers that are more suited to their investment strategies or needs; â¢ for the sell-side to evaluate buy side targets; â¢ to identify all owners of a given company and seek investors engagements; â¢ to evaluate potential investor activism; â¢ to evaluate who to partner with to start a campaign; â¢ to identify opportunities for individual investors; and â¢ to help legal departments to expedite their claims for affected parties. The effects of the proposal on smaller companies should also be considered. Increasing the threshold would have a larger impact on small and mid-cap public companies as they typically have a larger portion of shareholders that fall below the $3.5 billion threshold in assets under management. Small-cap firms would lose transparency on 15% of their shareholders while mid-cap firms would lose transparency on 10%. As data providers and analysts, Market Intelligence has often seen smaller investment managers play an active role with long term strategy and business operations. In some cases, this relationship can have significant effects on the management of smaller companies. CONCLUSION At Market Intelligence, our analysis and information help market participants create successful shareholder engagement programs, but to do so, companies need to be able to identify their shareholders. With few sources of information that currently exist on this subject, 13F data is a vital source of information that helps provide transparency to global markets, particularly for small and medium firms. Market Intelligence appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the Proposed Amendment. We believe regulatory reform efforts around reporting of public company shareholders are of critical importance, and we look forward to sharing our views with the Commission as you move forward on these initiatives in the future. Market Intelligence welcomes the opportunity to continue to be part of the ongoing dialogue on this important issue. Thank you for considering our comments and for your work on this important topic. Sincerely, Martina Cheung President"
