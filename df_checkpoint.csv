Adjusting this rule only helps large institutional money cut costs and hide potentially nefarious actions. It doesn’t protect the general public in any way. Please help the general public keep an eye on our institutions. The government’s job is to protect it’s citizens. This change only helps the large investment institutions hide potentially fraudulent or risky activities. More transparency is always better for individual investors and the markets as a whole, so please reject this proposal. Thank you, Nathan Barron, Concerned Investor"

David Kwon,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-20153230-320713.pdf,,"David Kwon December 20, 2022 Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, I am writing to you regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s proposal to update the 13(f) rule which was announced in 2020 . This proposal sparked a lot of debate and discussion about the benefits and costs of the 13(f) rule and about i nvestment disclosure more generally. For example, while the SEC’s proposal suggested the existence of disclosure costs in the form of copycatting (and frontrunning) activities, a recent bill proposed by Congresswoman Maxine Waters to expand investment disc losure suggests that copycatting is minimal. My recent dissertation on the 13(f) rule (completed while I was in a n accounting PhD program at Yale University) addresses this debate and has relevant findings for this proposal. My dissertation found many iss ues with the 13(f) rule , which requires institutional investors to disclose stock holdings . First of all, despite the US government ’s desire under the 13(f) rule to monitor institutional trading activity and monitor the impact of institutions on market stability especially in times of stress , the government curiously decided to only require stock s to be disclos ed, resulting in only about 15% of institutional assets being disclosed on 13(f) forms today . A full 85% of institutiona l investments is not being monitored by the government. The chart below shows in green the instruments that must be disclosed, and the instruments in grey that are not , and the following chart shows the percentage of institutional portfolios that is disclo sed across institutional categories. The 13(f) rule thus creates a discriminatory disclosure environment among institutional investors simply based on the instruments they use; a small - cap value manager has to disclose all of its portfolio (assuming it meets the 13(f) threshold), while a global macro hedge fund that uses only derivatives can keep its portfolio secret. The stock -specific nature of the 13(f) disclosure rule also means that institutions of similar size, similar type, or facing similar economic exposures can face different disclosure treatment under the rule.

I find that a subset of institutional stock investors – long -term stock investors (that are top -performing) – are the primary tar get of copycats due to lower replication risk. Copycats face lower risk when trying to copy long -term investors like Warren Buffett than when copying short -term investors because copycats are better able to successfully match the portfolio of long -term inv estors. For example, a simple strategy copying Buffett’s 13 (f) holdings would have generated 95% of Buffett’s annualized return performance over 40 years. In fact, t op-performing long -term stock investors, including long -term hedge funds and pension funds, face significant positive market reactions to their disclosures of newly purchased stock, while top -performing short -term stock investors do not see positive market reactions. In the two charts below, I first show market reactions to Warren Buffett’s stoc k disclosures and we can see that only his new stock purchases receive substantial market reactions upon disclosure, suggesting evidence of copycats, and in the next chart I show that among pension funds, only top -performing long -term pension funds experie nce a significant market reaction upon disclosure of newly purchased stock (shown by the blue line). Lastly, I show in portfolio simulations that while short -term investors, to the extent that they face any copycatting, likely benefit from the positive market reactions caused by outside copycats, long -term investors do not benefit and can even be harmed. The reason for this is that the positive market reactions due to copycatting merely frontload returns, rather than increase returns permanently. Take Warren Buffett for example, who may have some special insight into a specific stock. A long -term investor like Buffett may not expect to benefit over the long -run from the positive market reactions caused by outside copycats, if he expects his special insight on the stock to be incorporated into the stock price over time anyways, regardless of copycatting. In other words, assuming that market reactions from copycatting merely correct an undervaluation, a long -term investor is likely to not benefit from such market reactions over the long run. I test and confirm these predictions in a sample of hedge funds and pension funds. Since copycats cause long -term stock investors to experience excess volatility in their returns without higher returns, my study finds that long -term stock investors ’ risk - adjusted returns are being harmed under the 13 (f) rule. The chart belo w shows that copycatted stocks (those with high market reactions) do not outperform non -copycatted stocks for long - term hedge funds. However, high market reaction stocks do outperform for short -term and medium -term hedge funds. The following table below sh ows in portfolio simulations that copycatting activity negatively impacts targeted (i.e., copied) long -term investors’ Sharpe ratios. The next chart shows that in my sample of long -term hedge funds , their Sharpe ratios are especially harmed when they have larger assets (when they are building up positions more often and therefore more likely to be harmed by copycatting). My study helps inform the government on the costs of investment disclosure as it contemplates whe ther to “fill in the gaps” of disclosure. I show that when investment disclosure is required, this results in excess volatility in the stock holdings of top -performing long -term stock investors without benefitting their portfolio returns over time, and even sometimes harming portfolio returns over time as they grow larger in assets. So, my dissertation suggests that long -term stock investment (and therefore innovation, which requires a long -term investing horizon) in the economy is being disincentivized in favor of short -term trading under the 13(f) rule . Due to these significant public disclosure costs, while at the same time considering the government’s desire to monitor institutional activity in financial markets, I recommend that the government eliminate the 13(f) rule and create a new rule that require s large investors like institutions (and even individuals with significant assets) to disclose complete portfolio holdings privately to regulators . This would have the benefit of rem oving public disclosure costs while at the same time allowing those in the government with confidential access to monitor investment activity across asset classes and financial instruments and to look for excessive trading especially in time of stress , whi ch after all was the original vision of the 13(f) rule. Here is the link to my dissertation if you would like to read further. Thank you ! Sincerely, David Kwon"

Compared to Malaysia where this information is impossible to find without connections to insiders. This has lead to the Malaysian stock market losing trust from the public as large investors release news to manipulate the market for their benefit. My family, including my parents and in-laws who have been trying to store their assets in the Malaysian market for decades, have since transferred their money over to the US Stock exchanges since I've told them about how transparent and easy it is to find information to make educated investments in the US. Though I am not an American citizen I know I speak for the foreign investors from countries that have less transparent stock exchanges when I say this proposed change to end the 13F filings for fund between 100million to 3.5 billion will hurt the common investor's ability to confidently invest in the US stock market.

Going from a threshold of 100 million to 3.5 billion is to large. I understand the reasons behind why 13f was created in the first place, I understand why the small manager has compliance costs and why they would want to be rid of them. However the aforementioned increase is to large, perhaps a middle ground compromise is in order. The uses of the 13f have evolved as the data points increased and this has had many unintended positive consequences. To eliminate so many small managers from the data points would eliminate all those positive consequences and findings. I understand the simple fix yet hard decision would be to raise the gate, but the question you pose is more complicated than that. That is why I propose amending 13f as you have stated while creating another separate filing that can cover the smaller dollar figures and smaller managers. A separate filing that can be much simpler, less comprehensive and less expensive. Certainly if the SEC can amend the forms then certainly they do not need congress to create a new one for them. The new filing could be called form \""13s\"" homage to the 13f with the \""s\"" standing for \""small\"". Thank you for reading."
Branislav Jovan,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-225321.htm,,"Nov. 10, 2020 Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are. Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. The “justification” for the rule change is highly questionable. When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor? Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The S&P suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more."

Information about the price, the percentage of an investors portfolio, and the price the stock was purchased at is so helpful in deciding if a particular company merits my purchase at this time for this price.Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the professional investors from filing.

"John S. Hess, Jr., EVP, Deputy General Counsel, United Therapeutics Corp.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7877667-224129.pdf,,"1 Via Electronic Submission Octob er 5, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34 -89290 File No. S7- 08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: This letter is submitted on behalf of United Therapeutics Corporation, a biotechnology company co -headquartered in Sliver Spring, Maryland and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (the “Company ” or “we”), in response to the request for comments by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission ”) in the proposing release referenced above (the “ Proposing Release ”). As set forth in the Proposing Release, the Commission has proposed amendments to R ule 13f -1 (“Rule 13f -1”) under Section 13(f) (“ Section 13(f) ”) the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act ”) and Form 13F to increase the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion and to increase the information provided by institutional investment managers, respectively . United Therapeutics thanks the Commission for this opportunity to comment on the proposed amendm ents to R ule 13f -1 and Form 13F and the Commission’s efforts to impr ove reporting by institutional investment managers . Summary of Our Comments We concur with the Commission’s view that the R ule 13f -1 reporting system is outdated and in need of modernization. We are supportive of the Commission’s objective s to “reflect the changes in the structure of the market that have occurred over time.”1 However, w e believe that the proposed revision to R ule 13f -1 is unlikely to accomplish Section 13(f)’s goal of “improv[ing] the body of factual data available regarding t he holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitat[ing] consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets”2 or the Commission’s objective of providing useful information to shareholde rs. 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34 -89290, 13, 20 (July 10, 2020) . 2 Id. at 9. 2 We believe that, as proposed, the change in threshold for reporting under R ule 13f -1 will instead impair the usefulness of the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers . The consequence will be a sign ificant loss of transparency into the shareholdings of our company and other publicly- traded companies in the market, thereby impeding companies’ abilities to meaningfully engage with shareholders. Discussion A. Transparency 1. Shareholder Engagement Over the past several decades , Rule 13f -1 has been one of the driving factors in a remarkable evolution in companies’ engagement with their shareholders . Each year, companies like ours discuss key concerns and initiatives with shareholders, both when preparing annual proxy statements and when considering significant company actions. Form 13F filings are integral and unique source s of ownership information for companies showing who their significant shareholders are, which is a starting point for shareholder engagement. Under the Commission’s proposal, 89% of current Form 13F filers would go dark3, representing several steps back ward from this previously- achieved increase in company -shareholder engagement. While the Commission’s rationale for increasing the threshold rests on creating parity with the portion of the market that was targeted at the time of the rule’s initial adoption in 1975, this ignores the dramatic alteration in the relationships between companies and their shareholders since then. S hareholder engagement has become a market standard of good corporate governance , with the result that market participants have increasingly become productive company participants alongside management and boards of directors. Increasing the R ule 13f -1 threshold would allow the largest institutional investment managers to continue this participation, but could have the effect of exclud ing those shareholders with (relatively) smaller positions —even if they are more active in the company’s stock than some larger, more passive investor s. Management has limited time to devote to shareholder engagement and must choose which shareholders to prioritize . More information about all the company’s significant investors , whether they be large or relatively small in scale, allows management to make better -informed decisions about how to allocate its time. For some companies , particularly smaller -cap companies , it may be information on the smaller, more active investors that is more valuable — both from the standpoint of engaging with interested shareholders and detecting activist hedge funds. Final ly, proxy advisor y firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass -Lewis have come to expect detailed disclosure regarding the extent of an issuer ’s shareholder outreach efforts , which ofte n includes precise per centages of an issuer ’s shares that were included in such 3 IHS Markit , SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis , Corporate Secretary ( August 7, 2020), https://ihsmarkit.com/research -analysis/secs -13f-proposal --issuer -and-investor -analysis.html . 3 efforts. These disclosures would become i mpossible with out the information avai lable from Form 13F filings. 2. Detecting Activis m According to the IHS Markit, 86% of activist managers would go dark under the Commission’s proposed new threshold, which will be a loss in transparency not for the biggest companies in the market, but for the smaller companies that are more frequently targeted by activists.4 Particularly in this time of market volatility due to COVID -19, more insight into how a company’s stock is trading and held is needed, not less. With a $3.5 bill ion threshold, companies will have a diminished ability to monitor activist movement s that might take advantage of this market volatility. In addition, experts are warning that , just as activist investing “rose significantly after the 2008 financial crisi s,” it may spike as the economy rebounds from COVID -19.5 Indeed, “[a] ctivist investors may focus their attention on companies that … already have significant activist representation in their stocks and those facing new vulnerabilities ”6—that is, those companies that most need the information provided by Form 13F about who is trading in and out of their stock. These same experts encourage companies to prepare for such activism by engaging with investors and monitoring changes in the company’s shareholder base .7 With a 35x increase in the R ule 13f -1 reporting threshold, a company will not know if an activist investment manager is planning a proxy contest until that activist is compelled to disclose its position on Form 13D —the deadline for which is 10 days after that threshold is crossed. Although this is a shorter time frame than the current Form 13F filing deadline, a moderate Form 13F filing threshold still increases the chance that an activist will have to report an accumulation of a company’s stock before it reac hes the Form 13D threshold. It is also important to note that, since the adoption of Section 13(f) in 1975, the marketplace and media landscape have evolved in a way that has allowed small, vocal market participants to greatly increase their significance to public companies, including through use of derivative securities, which are not even subject to reporting under Rule 13f -1. Any consideration of changes to the reporting threshold must take this present reality into account. 3. Inadequate Alternativ es We recognize that there may be other ways for a company to determine its stock ownership, such as the use of private stock surveillance firms and Forms N -PORT and 13D/13G. However, none of these options are as useful and/or reliable as Form 13F. Not only do private 4 Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy – Edelman , Yahoo!

Even then, Forms 13D and 13G are not reliable when activists form “wolf packs” whereby, acting in concert, each act ivist will accumulate less than 5% of a company’s securities and then not report themselves as a 13D group. Under SEC rules, companies communicate with their beneficial owners primarily through broker or bank intermediaries. However, t he “OBO/NOBO” rules allow a beneficial owner to prohibit direct contact by a company in which it holds stock if it objects to disclosure of its identity . Moreover, beneficial owner s can also prohibit disclosure of the amount of their holdings in a company. Thus, reliance on these other rules to give companies insight into their shareholder base would be misplaced . Any large shareholder that would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold for institutional investment managers could also elect to prohibit disclosure of its identity and/or holdings to a company through the OBO/NOBO rules. The rationale in the Proposing Release relies all too heavily on the purported high estimated compliance costs. While w e acknowledge that institutional investment manage rs are required to incur additional compliance costs when they are subject to Rule 13f -1, that cost, even for smaller investment managers , is not unduly burdensome. Developments in technology, which have given institutional investors instant access to det ailed information regarding their holdings and have allowed them to submit Form 13F electronically, have made compliance with this rule significantly easier and less costly than it was several decades ago. Given the lack of alternative sources for the inf ormation Rule 13f -1 provides to the marketplace , the value of this information to issuers and investors alike is significant. Not only is Rule 13f -1 straightforward and simple to comply with, but a single manager’s Form 13F typically provides valuable information to multiple companies and other investors. Thus, the benefits of the Rule 13f -1 reporting system far exceed the modest cost it imposes. B. Impact on Capital Formation While large shareholders are likely to have already adopted a positive position with respect to investing in that particular company, many companies use Forms 13F to identify smaller shareholders who have not yet invested a significant amount in the company but may be willing to. As another facet of shareholder engagement, management may reach out to these shareholders , not just for opinions on company actions, but also to discuss the possibility of making additional investments to provide the company with growth capital. Such a significant increase in the R ule 13f -1 reporting threshold cuts off companies’ visibility and accessibility 8 Even after the 60 -day delay following the end of the investment company ’s fiscal quarter , only the information from the last month of the fisc al quarter is made available. See General Instruction F to Form N -PORT. 5 regarding these smaller shareholders , thereby limiting companies’ potential capital raising opportunities . For earlier -stage companies in the biotech industry, capital raising is an essent ial tool to speed the development of potential live -saving therapies. C. Effect on Our Company We strive to maintain strong relationships with our shareholders as part of our commitment to corporate governance. In 2019, members of our Board of Directors invited discussions with shareholders in the spring and in the fall who collectively hold about 70% of our outstanding shares. These conversat ions with shareholder s give us deeper insight into our shareholders’ perspectives and help inform our Board of Director s’ decisions on strategy, governance, compensation, and sustainability. Some of the actions we have taken in response to shareholder feedback over the past several years include the adoption of majority voting, the adoption of proxy access, the de -classification of our Board of Directors, and the initiation of our environmental, social, and governance disclosure program. Notably, the design of our four -year equity grant for 2019- 2022 was in direct response to feedback received during our ongoing shareholder engagements. If the threshold for R ule 13f -1 is raised to $3.5 billion, we would expect to lose information on approximately 75% of our current Form 13F filers . Many of the remaining filers are passive holders that do not significantly change from quarter to quarter . As with many companies, especially small- and mid- cap companies, the information we gain on smaller investors from Form 13F filings is just as, if not more, important to our company than is the information on larger, passive investors. Over the past 12 months, we have engaged with over 40 investors who would not be required to file under the new threshold. D. Proposed Reforms We agree with the Commission that a reform of Rule 13f -1 is necessary and timely, including a possible increase to the threshold for filing. However, we urge the Commission to consider a more nuanced approach to the new filing threshold instead of a simpl e increase based on proportionate market share . We agree with the National Investor Relations Institute’s proposal to increase the threshold to $450 million, which is based on a Consumer Price Index adjustment.9 Such an increase would be a less shocking to the market and, in tandem with the following additional reforms (particularly the first), would accomplish a more holistic approach to bringing Rule 13f -1 into the 21st century while also enhancing its usefulness. • First, we recommend adjusting the filing threshold every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. This would provide ongoing review and consideration of the filing threshold as it relates to current market conditions. It would also set 9 National Investor Relations Institute , The Case for 13F Reform (September 25, 2019), https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019- final.pdf . Also, this assumes that the Commission has the authority to increase the th reshold above $100 million, which is not free from doubt as discussed in Section E. below. 6 compan ies’ and investors’ expectations for the threshold, precluding undue reliance on a particular number. • Second , we recommend shortening the reporting deadline from 45 days to 10 days after the end of the quarter. The significant delay between quarter -end and the filing deadline causes information to often be outdated when it is released to the market . This can allow an investor that purports to be a large shareholder to influence the company when, in fact, that investor’s position has changed since the last Form 13F filing.10 This can also allow activists to accumulate large portions of the company’s stock early in a calendar quarter and leave the company in the dark as to its significant shareholders until several months later. In addition, t he 45- day reporting period was established 30 years ago and was the result of practical considerations that are no longer applicable in light of the increased sophistication of institutional investors and advances in information technology, which often all ow institutional managers to ascertain their exact holdings as of month end within a matter of minutes. Thirty years ago, computers, the Internet , and EDGAR were all in their infancy ; today we have technology that allows for real -time reporting. • Third, we recommend that all filers be required to disclose long, short, derivative, and outright positions in a company’s stock, and that all positions be aggregated together (not netted) to determine if the threshold is met. This would provide a more accurate picture of where an investor stands in relation to a particular company. • Finally, we recommend that the Commission reconsider its current procedure for handling confidential treatment requests related to Form 13F filings . Institutiona l managers can request confidential treatment of specific positions, and the current system effectively grants confidential treatment during the period between application and final determination on a request, which can be several months long.11 Like the long deadline discussed in the first bullet above, this causes information to quickly become stale, thereby defeating the rule’s purpose and function of providing the markets with transparency on holdings . E. Authority While we commend the Commission on its effort to reform R ule 13f -1, we are nevertheless concerned about its authority to do so under Section 13(f) in the proposed manner. Section 13(f) states, in relevant part, “[e] very institutional investment manager … which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) … having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in 10 National Investor Relations Institute, NIRI Advocacy Issues Survey – 2018 (August 2018) (46% of respondents reported that investors had misrepresented their positions to gain a meeting with the company’s management ). 11 Christian Bonser, If You Only Knew the Power of the Dark Side: An Analysis of the One-Sided Long Position Hedge Fund Public Disclosure Regime and a Call for Short Position Inclusion, 22 Fordham J. Corp. & Fin. L. 327, 365 (2017) . 7 any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine , shall file reports with the Commission …” (emphasis added). A plain reading of the text shows that Congress set the upper limit at $100 million, and t he Commission has the authority to lower , but not increase, the threshold. For the amount to be raised, Congress needs to amend Section 13(f) to either raise the threshold or give the Commission the specific authority to do so. Conclusion We appreciate the Commission ’s efforts, and willingness, to modernize Rule 13f -1; however, increasing the filing threshold to $3.5 billion will only serve to significantly reduce market transparency and impair many companies’ ability to engage with their shareholders and detect activist activity in their stock by allowing a significant portion of current Form 13F filers to essentially go dark. We are of the opinion that the Commission does not thoroughly consider and address this loss of transparency in the Proposing Release —indeed, as Commissioner Lee notes in her dissent, “[t]he costs of losing transparency are glossed over in brief narrative form and largely discounted.”12 Because t he alternative sources of information are incomplete and, in some cases, prohibitively expensive, w e urge the Commission to take a more measured approach to the Rule 13f -1 filing threshold, and propose revisions to it in tandem with other reforms that would enhance the usefulness of information f rom the Rule 13f -1 disclosure system. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Proposing Release and respectfully request that the Commission consider our re commendations and suggestions.

We focus on issues affecting the profession of financial analysis and investment management, education and competencies for investment professionals, and on issues of fairness, transparency, and accountability of global financial markets. Executive Summary Considerations of market trans parency and integrity lead us to oppose the Proposal. The Proposal would raise the 13(f) filing threshold by a factor of 35 times, from $100 million in assets under management to $3.5 billion. Nearly 90 percent of current filers, comprising more than 4,500 institutional investment managers with $2.322 trillion in reported assets, would no longer be subject to the 13(f) filing requirement.3 The resulting loss of holdings information would harm market participants such as, among others, investors, issuers, re searchers, and the affected institutional investment managers themselves. We consider the proposed 35 -fold increase in the reporting threshold to be excessive and, moreover, inconsistent with the Commission’s recent decision against adjusting the financia l 1 CFA Institute is a global, not -for-profit professional association of nearly 171,400 investment analysts, ad visers, portfolio managers, and other investment professionals in 165 countries, of whom more than 164,000 hold the Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA®) designation.

Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 2 thresholds in the accredited investor definition. We believe it is the accredited investor definition, rather than the 13(f) reporting requirement, that needs updated thresholds.4 The Commission argues the higher proposed threshold would purport with th e purpose of the Act, which it suggests is to focus exclusively on large institutional investment managers. According to this argument, the growth of securities markets has rendered the original (and current) reporting threshold of $100 million irrelevant to the Act’s focus on large investment managers. In our view, the enabling statute, in section 13(f)(1), only gives the Commission authority to lower the threshold, not to raise it. Therefore, the Proposal conflicts to with the legislative history and Con gressional intent. We also believe the Proposal would run counter to other statutory objectives, such as the needs to build investor confidence, enable issuers to identify their beneficial owners, afford an understanding of the effect of institutional inv estor activities on individual securities, and serv as a single centralized repository of certain holdings data. And finally, we believe the economic analysis falls short in establishing a baseline of current practices and assessing the costs and benefits of the proposed rulemaking in a thorough and impartial manner.5 Discussion of the Proposal How Investors and Others Use and Benefit from 13(f) Disclosures The elimination of 13(f) data on the scale proposed in this rulemaking would have a harmful effect on securities markets and their participants, including, among others, investors, issuers, and institutional investment managers themselves. The significant number of letters from investors who use and value the 13(f) disclosures that would be lost under this Proposal should alert the Commission to the disclosures’ value to market participants. It also provides strong evidence that the proposed reduction in d isclosures would undermine investor confidence, thus undermining one of the statutory objectives of the 13(f) framework. The comment file also makes clear that market participants benefit from 13(f) disclosures in a variety of ways. Investors use the fili ngs for due diligence on smaller investment managers. The loss of the holdings data, therefore, would impede such due diligence and potentially reduce demand for smaller investment managers, the group of investment managers the Proposal is intending to ben efit. 4 See James C.

Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 3 Investors also use the data to detect fraud;6 and to analyze hedge funds’ crowded trades7 and assess levels of their crowding risk;8 and to aid in price discovery.9 Consequently, the loss of these disclosures would likely have a significant and nega tive effect on investors as well as on market risks and efficiency. Securities issuers use 13(f) data to identify beneficial owners, particularly for smaller issuers that lack the resources to engage a proxy solicitor to understand their shareholder bases .10 It is, in fact, the smaller institutional investors that are more likely to hold securities of small -cap companies.11 Therefore, eliminating their 13(f) holding filing would likely harm small -cap issuers, in particular, and ultimately impede issuer outre ach and issuer -shareholder dialogue, good -governance practices the Commission has specifically encouraged.12 The Proposal suggests that the relevant data from smaller institutional investors is unneeded because of their limited ability to affect securities markets.13 While that may be true for the largest of large cap stocks, investment managers with AUM between $100 million and $3.5 billion do have significant potential to move the prices of small or mid -cap securities which, as noted above, they tend to ho ld more frequently than large managers. What matters is not the total assets managed by a manager, but the volume of buy or sell transaction(s) the firm generates in comparison with a security’s trading depth and liquidity. This is a particularly relevant consideration because, again, these smaller managers are more likely to hold the stocks of 6 See Doron Cohen, Hedge Fund Due Diligence , comment letter on File No. S7 -08-20, (July 14, 2020 ), at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415172 -219344.htm . 7 Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg, “Goldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding,” (July 20, 2020), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 8 Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg, “Goldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding,” (July 20, 2020), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 9 Joanna Ossinger , Bloomberg, “Goldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding ,” (July 20, 2020 ), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could - shroud -hedge -fund -crowding (last checked Sept. 20, 2020). 10 See, e.g., National Investor Relations Institute, The Case for 13F Reform (Sept. 25, 2019), available at https://www.niri.org /NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019 -final.pdf (observing, “The lack of ownership transparency is of particular concern to smaller issuers that cannot afford to pay for stock surveillance firms that analyze trading patterns and try to de termine which investors are buying or selling shares.”) 11 Proposal at 23, citing Blume and Keim as “providing evidence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocks …”). 12 Chair Mary Jo White, Remarks at the 10th Annual Transatlantic Corporate Governance Dialogue, (Dec. 3, 2013), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2013 -spch110313mjw , (saying, “ Engagement with shareholders should mean more than just mailing out the annual proxy statement and conducting the annual meeting.

The need for public disclosure of holdings of smaller managers is less compelling…[T]he dollar value of the aggregate holdings of the smaller managers that would no longer be required to file reports on Form 13F under the proposal represent a small percentage of 13(f) securities overall.”) Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 4 smaller companies.14 The 13(f) disclosures, therefore, provide valuable information that would be lost under this Proposal. Academic researchers, too, use the 13(f) d ata to discern and analyze a variety of investing trends, including, for example, track the rise of passive and index investing. Academic research plays an essential part in creating an informed marketplace, informed investors, and informed regulators.15 Finally, attorneys use these filings in private securities class action matters, including determining lower -bound estimates of damages. Such private actions have important and positive spill-over benefits for enforcement, as the Proposal describes.16 The P roposal suggests users might be able to find similar data from alternative disclosure sources. The alternatives cannot, however, replace the 13(f) framework, which serves as a central repository of holdings data.17 Increase in the Reporting Threshold The proposed 35 -fold increase in the reporting threshold, together with the elimination of information about89.2 percent of current filers, goes well beyond the rate of inflation, which would result in an increase of four or five times (to $400 million or $50 0 million).18 Rather, the Commission chooses to base the change in threshold on the growth in the markets and entities it regulates.19 While we would not expect the Commission to suggest limiting its regulatory activities to only the largest regulated enti ties, this Proposal proposes something analogous: namely, to drastically reduce the number of investment managers subject to the disclosure rule because of the growth of capital markets. It is in the contrast of the Commission’s approach to addressing chan ges over time in these thresholds with the approach applied in the accredited investor definition where the disparities are most glaring. In the newly adopted amendments to the accredited investor definition, for instance,, the Commission rejected adjustme nts to its wealth and income thresholds to address nearly four decades of inflation where an effective threshold is needed to ensure retail accredited investors have the financial ability, investing understanding, and access to advisory support to 14 Proposal at 23, citing Blume and Keim as “providing evidence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocks…”) . 15 The Commission’s guidance on economic analysis states, “In addition to the direct benefits and co sts, the economic analysis should address significant ancillary economic consequences.” If the impact on academic research is considered to be an ancillary economic consequence, it would still be significant and should be analyzed alongside the impact on d irect market participants. Current Guidance at 10. 16 The Proposal states, “Commission staff has noted that ‘meritorious private actions have long been recognized as an important supplement to civil and criminal law -enforcement actions.’” Proposal at 22, fo otnote 51 . 17 We discuss this in more detail on page 8 . 18 According to the Proposal, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (“PCE”) would result in a reporting threshold of $500 million and $400 million, respec tively. Proposal at 20. 19 See, e.g., SEC, Fiscal Year 2021 Congressional Budget Justification at 30, at https://www.sec.gov/files/secfy21congbudgjust.pdf , (saying, “Most importantly, the siz e of the SEC -regulated community continues to grow in volume and complexity, and significantly exceeds existing resource levels.”) Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 5 invest i n illiquid, opaque, and higher risks of fraud of private markets. These are palpable risks that can be financially devastating to such investors. No comparable risks or regulatory burdens confront institutional investment managers subject to this disclosur e. According to the Proposal, investment firms would enjoy direct savings of only $15,000 to $30,000 per filer per year (assuming, as valid, proposed compliance estimates that are in question.) It is inconsistent that the Commission would reject the oppor tunity to adjust the accredited investor wealth thresholds for inflation and then propose a 35x increase for the 13(f) reporting threshold. Should the Commission decide to proceed with this Proposal, we recommend 2010 as the base year for growth, rather th an 1975. Though Congress first adopted 13(f) legislation in 1975, it chose to retain that same threshold when it amended that very sentence in the Dodd -Frank Act, which became law on July 21, 2010.20 Since then, the S&P 500 has increased by a factor of 3.3 times. Therefore, a proportional change in the 13(f) reporting threshold would increase it to $330 million, not $35 billion. Finally, we hope the proposed 35 -fold increase will not drive a process that results in a less extreme but still unwarranted increa se.21 Assumptions of the Proposal The Proposal is based on an argument that the purpose of the Act was to provide information about large institutional investment managers that have the power to affect the markets. Thus, by removing filing obligations fo r nearly 90 percent of current filers, the Proposal “is designed to reflect proportionally the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million represented in 1975.”22 In this view, the information to be eliminated is unneeded, because the universe of t hose smaller institutional investors and their holdings were not originally intended to be captured by the statute.23 We find this argument inappropriate and extraneous. The only language relevant to the Commission’s interpretation, application, and enforc ement of this mandate is in the statute, which requires 13(f) reports from institutional investment managers with AUM “of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser 20 See Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, SEC. 13A. Reporting and Recordkeeping for Certain Security -Based Swaps (amending Section 13(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ). 21 An analogous process played out with the Proxy Advisory rulemaking, with the Commission first proposing but eventually removing a requiring for two sets of issuer reviews before a proxy advisory firm could send its report to its clients. If the final rule can be perceived as a compromise, it is one proceeding from an egregious starting position. The final rule will still result in an unacceptable interference in the indepen dence of proxy advisory firms. 22 Proposal at 12. 23 See also Proposal at 21 ( “The legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed to focus on larger managers …We believe that section 13(f) was intended to provide tran sparency into a certain segment of the securities markets —the equity holdings by larger institutional investment managers.” ). Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 6 amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall fi le reports…”24 The proposal to raise the threshold above $100 million , therefore, conflicts with the explicit language of the statute itself. More over, Congress recently , by default, reaffirmed this intention in the 2010 amendment that left the $100 million threshold intact.25 Even if the Commission were to show that its authority derived from another section of the statute, it would face the additional hurdle of showing that an increased threshold s omehow better reflected Congressional intention when the Act expressly included in 13(f)(1) the limiting phrase, “or such lower amount.” The Proposal also cites a report of the SEC Inspector General (“IG Report”) that recommended the Commission “determine whether an increase in the threshold amount should be pursued.”26 The IG Report clearly implied the need for the Commission to seek legislative authority before it could raise the threshold above $100 million. Specifically, Recommendation 10 states that various Divisions and Offices within the Commission, including those of the General Counsel and the Chairman’s Office, “should determine whether legislative changes to Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should be sought , specifically with re spect to…[a number of measures, including] increasing the Section 13(f) reporting threshold.”27 Finally, it cites section 13(f)(3) as giving the Commission authority to exempt any manager or class of managers from the reporting requirements of section 13(f) . Application of the phrase, “any class of managers,” to exempt nearly 90% of firms currently reporting under the rule is not just questionable as to its suitability but also whether it defeats the explicit instruction of 13(f)(1). It is also unclear wheth er such an interpretation could withstand court challenge, but also raises the question of whether such a use of finite and limited Commission funding is best used for this purpose. Thus, the context shows that Congressional focus on the largest instituti onal investment managers was qualified with respect to timing (“limited initially”) and start -up efficiencies (“rapid implementation while minimizing costs and burdens”). The same qualifications do not necessarily hold upon full implementation of the regul ation. On the contrary, the statute held 24 Section 13(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1)) . 25 See Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, SEC. 13A.

Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 7 forth the possibility that the Commission might determine to expand the regulation to cover investment managers that fell under the initial $100 million threshold. The proposed increase in the filing threshold also would run counter to several other objectives of the Act. These include the following objectives, all noted above: to increase investor confidence;28 to gain an understanding of the impact of institutional investment activities on individual securities;29 to help issuers identify beneficial owners; and to serve as a central repository of the reported holdings data. The Proposal suggests that alternative sources of holdings data “may provide overlapping or similar data to that included on Form 13F.”30 Specifica lly, it names two such sources: mutual fund holding data filed on Form N -PORT, and a future consolidated audit trail (CAT) of trading activity in National Market System securities.31 In addition, one might also consider Schedule 13d or 13g data as potential alternatives. Reliance on such alternatives, however, would defeat a central purpose of the 13(f) framework: namely “to achieve uniform, centralized reporting” of the holdings data.32 Instead, the Proposal would resurrect for most firms the very dispersion problem that the 13(f) legislation was designed to solve. Moreover, the two specifically named alternative sources would fail to replace the proposed loss of current 13(f) disclosures. Form N -PORT contains holdings data filed by registered investment comp anies, a category that comprises a subset of the universe of institutional investment managers that file 13(f) holdings data. And not only is the CAT not yet in existence, its future development is far from certain. And even if the CAT becomes a reality, its transactions data would not be publicly disclosed and therefore could not serve as an alternative source for the public. Nor would the data in Schedules 13D or 13G serve to meet investors’ needs, given that they are limited to of investors who have acq uired more than 5 percent of a company’s equity securities. These disclosures would fail to capture any holdings under the 5 percent ownership threshold, regardless of the size of the investment manager. For these reasons, we disagree with the principal c ontention in the Release that the proposal would return the universe of 13(f) filers and filings to a more faithful representation of the original statutory intent. 28 See Senate Report, at 82 (saying, “ Thus, with the dissemination of data about institutional investment managers, an institutional disclosure program should stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of our securities markets. ” 29 Proposal at 23, ( citing Blume and Keim as “providing evi dence that portfolios of smaller institutional investors are weighted more heavily towards smaller stocks.”). 30 Proposal a t 24. 31 Proposal at 24-25. 32 15 U.S. Code § 78m . Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 8 Concerns with the Economic Analysis The Economic Analysis contained in this Proposal does not adhere to the Commission’s own standards, as articulated in its own guidance on the topic. The Proposal falls short in establishing a baseline of current practices and impartially assessing the costs and benefits of the proposed rulemaking. 33 We note that the Proposal contains no separate section for the Economic Analysis, but instead offers comments scattered throughout the text.34 A separate section focused on the Economic Analysis would make clear its level of rigor, depth and soundness.35 Likewi se, the Economic Analysis should clearly label the analysis of the baseline. While the Proposal includes components of a baseline, the word itself never appears in the Proposal. The Baseline The Economic Analysis establishes a baseline against which to mea sure the likely economic consequences of the proposed regulation. The baseline is “the best assessment of how the world would look in the absence of the proposed action.”36 It should describe not only the investment managers that file 13(f) disclosures, but also who uses the data, how they use it, and what benefits they derive from it.37 The descriptions should be quantified to the extent possible. In its request for public comments, the Proposal asks the right questions about who uses the data and what the benefits of those uses are for investors and the market.38 The Proposal answers these questions with minimal detail. It simply says: 33 SEC, Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings , Memo (March 6, 2012), available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf (identifying the elements as follows: “(1) a statement of the need for the proposed action; (2) the definition of a baseline against which to measure the likely economic consequences of the proposed regulation; (3) the identification of alternative regulatory approaches; and (4) an evaluation of the benefits and costs —both quantitative and qualitative —of the proposed action and the main alternatives identified by the analysis. ”). 34 The Proposal devotes a separate section to the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Analysis , and the economic analysis leans heavily on the PRA estimate. A PRA estimate, however, has more limited purposes than the economic analysis and cannot serve as a substitute for it. See RSFI and OGC, Memorandum: Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings, (March 6, 2012), at 11, available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf (stating, “With most rules, the cost estimate that results from multiplying PRA burden -hours by hourly wage rates is not substitutable for the broader analysis of a rule’s likely economic consequences contained in the Proposal’s economic analysis.”) 35 While not necessary in all rul emaking releases, a dedicated section for the economic analysis would be especially helpful here, because of its deficiencies. See Current Guidance at 15. 36 Current Guidance at 6. 37 Current Guidance at 7 (“ Defining the baseline typically involves identifyi ng and describing the market(s) and participants affected by the proposed rule. Most SEC rules affect one or more markets directly but it may also be appropriate to consider additional markets or participants that may be indirectly affected by the proposed rule. ”). 38 See, e.g., Question 11 at 2 8 (“Who uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and few er filers report?”) and Question 9 at 27 (“What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers?”). Proposal at 27 and 28. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 9 [T]he pool of users of the data has expanded to include academics, market researchers, the media, attorneys pursuing securit ies class action matters, and market participants (including institutional investors themselves) who use the data to enhance their ability to compete. The data can also assist individuals in making investment decisions, investment managers in managing asse ts, and corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock. Commission staff also uses Form 13F information for a variety of purposes…39 This does not go beyond that brief description and ex plain how users actually use the data and what benefits they derive from it. Assessing Costs of the Proposed Regulation The Economic Analysis also should include a thorough and impartial analysis of the potential costs and benefits of eliminating the 13(f) filing requirement for affected investment managers.40 In an earlier section, we identified a variety of users of 13(f) disclosures, the benefits they derive from those disclosures, and the harms that the loss of that data would entail.41 The economic analysis should assess with particularity how the proposed loss of data would affect each of these users and the market as a whole. Instead, the Economic Analysis offers little beyond a generalized assessment of these costs of the Proposal. For instance, the Proposal offers the following remark: “Whether any of these Form 13F data users find the data from smaller managers to be valuable would depend on their particular use of this data.” In addition, the Proposal asserts without evidence, “We believe that the investing public specifically would be less concerned about the availability of portfolio holdings of these smaller managers because the activities of these smaller managers are not likely to cause market effects of the type contemplated by section 13 (f).”42 As noted above, however, investment managers with assets between $100 million and $3.5 billion can have on material impact on the price of small or mid -cap securities. Whereas the Proposal bases its estimate of the benefits the higher threshold (in the form of compliance cost savings) on unspecified “outreach” to the affected asset managers, there is no comparable mention of any outreach to investors or other users to determine the potential costs of the 13(f) disclosures. Such outreach could bolste r understanding of the costs to eliminate 13(f) filing requirements for affected filers. And judging from the comment file, users and other market participants are not shy in expressing their views on this question. 39 Proposal a t 22. 40 Current Guidance at 4 (stating, “[A]n ev aluation of the benefits and costs —both quantitative and qualitative —of the proposed action and the main alternatives identified by the analysis.” ); and at 14 (Noting that the evaluation should “[f]rame costs and benefits neutrally and consistently.” ). 41 These include instilling investor confidence , gaining an understanding of the market impact of investment managers’ trading, and providing a range of other investor benefits. I ssuer s rely on the holdings information to identify their beneficial owners. In addition, the data is used in academic research and in private securities litigation, which in turn benefits civil and criminal law -enforcement actions . See supra discussion at 2 -4. 42 Proposal a t 24. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 10 Assessing Potential Benefits of the Proposal Congress set the $100 million threshold in 1975, and effectively reaffirmed it in 2010. In intervening decades, the advent of the IT revolution has brought advances in accounting and reporting software solutions to reduce processing and production costs. The Proposal tentatively acknowledges this, saying, “We believe that some of the direct compliance costs associated with preparing filings on Form 13F have decreased since 1975, principally due to lower -cost information processing systems.” It then downplays the significance of these lower costs by stating, “[I]n connection with staff outreach to advisers to smaller fund complexes, these advisers stated that reporting on Form 13F involves significant compliance burdens.” These findings run counter t o what we heard from CFA Charterholders who work in investment management firms and are familiar with 13(f) reporting. For example, the president of one investment management firm told us most firms with assets under management of more than $100 million ha ve portfolio accounting software programs that easily create reports. It is then a simple step to upload the reports to the SEC website for filing purposes. Not without controversy,43 the Proposal estimates total direct compliance costs at $113.6 million, or four times larger than the estimated $31.2 million that the Commission accepted just two years ago.44 The new estimate would translate into a direct compliance cost savings of $15,000 to $30,000 annually for each affected investment manager ($4,100 to $8 ,200 under the previously estimated rate) that would no longer have to file Forms 13F.45 Commissioner Lee offers an alternative estimate, based on the previous cost estimate, of $4,000 to 5,000 per affected manager.46 The Proposal asserts it “would provide m eaningful regulatory relief for smaller managers” without estimating cost savings in a quantitative context. The economic analysis should compare its estimated cost savings of $15,000 to $30,000 per manager to their other financial metrics, such as their a verage total compliance costs, average net income, average revenue, or average assets under management.47 At maximum – for a manager with $100 million of reported assets and an annual compliance cost of $30,000 – the total cost savings would amount to 3 bas is points (or 0.03 percent) of reported assets.48 The average percentage for the entire pool of affected managers would be far less, given that their assets would range from $100 million to $3.5 billion and the cost savings could be lower than $30,000. 43 See, e.g., Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting , (July 10, 2020), at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 44 The increase is driven, not by higher filing costs over the past two years, but instead by a proposed change in calculating those costs. Proposal at 41 -45. The Proposal bases the proposed change on staff analysis and unspecified “outreach to managers.” Pr oposal at 18. 45 Proposal at 18. 46 Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, (July 10, 2020), at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 47 If the Commission lacks all t he data to make these calculations, it should make reasonable assumptions to fill in any gaps . Failing that, it should explain why it cannot make such calculations. 48 This assumes that that $30,000 represents the incremental savings. The savings would be less if the manager had to devote some of the same resources to fulfill other accounting , reporting , or investment needs. Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 11 In our view, the estimated benefits would be far outweighed by the harm to transparency, market integrity, and investor needs. The Proposal also identifies two potential sources of indirect compliance costs: the possibility of front -running or copycatting bas ed on 13(f) disclosures. To conduct such analyses, however, the economic analysis must first provide evidence that the disclosures lead to these practices, and second, demonstrate that such practices cause harm to the affected filers. It couches these possibilities in tentative terms: Consequently, Form 13F data of smaller managers may be more likely to be used by other market participants to engage in behavior that is damaging to the manager and the beneficial owners of the managed portfolio, such as fro nt running (which primarily harms the beneficial owners) or copycatting (which potentially harms the portfolio manager)…14 Moreover, the current framework permits a 45 -day filing deferral to avoid these misadventures. They also may avoid these problems by requesting confidential treatment to protect their trades and trading strategies. The Proposal implies that the affected filers are more likely to request confidential treatment, noting that 75% of all Form 13F CTRs filed come from the targeted group of m anagers who account for 9.2% of total market AUM.49 A more relevant comparison, in our view, comes from comparing the frequency of confidentiality requests from the affected group against their prevalence in the total population of filers (89.2%).50 It is therefore reasonable to conclude that affected filers have less need for such confidentiality requests and are less likely to suffer harm from their 13(f) disclosures. The Pr oposal asserts, “The academic literature provides partial evidence about th e harm caused by the actions of third parties that is applicable in the context of the proposed amendments.”51 However, the most relevant study, the Christofferson Paper, finds that 13(f) filers strategically delay disclosures out of concern of front -runnin g, not copycatting.52 The study does not whether the delays succeed in protecting filers from front -running but does observe that investment institutions would benefit from copycatting if they intended to sell their recently purchased shares into a rising m arket.53 The same paper finds that small funds are less likely than larger funds to delay their disclosures, suggesting they see little need to protect themselves from front -running or copycatting. By 49 Proposal at 14. 50 Smaller managers also may have limited resources with which to file Form 13F CTRs to protect their competitive positions. 51 Proposal at 19. 52 See e.g., Susan E.K. Christoffersen, Erfan Danesh, and David Musto, Why Do Institutions Delay Their Shareholdings? Evidence from Form 13F , (Working Paper, June 11, 2018) (hereinafter“Chistoffersen et al”), available at https:// www.bwl.unimannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/bwl/Area_Finance/Finance_Area_Seminar/HWS2018/Chris toffersen_Paper.pdf (stating, “ We look at 14 years of 13F filings to gauge the role of these three motives in the decision to delay disclosure, and the results indi cate that front -running and voting, but not copycatting, motivate delays. ”). 53 Chistoffersen et al at 21 Comment Letter to SEC Re: File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers 29 September 2020 Page 12 extension, the same evidence casts doubt on the need fo r regulatory relief to protect these investment managers from such practices. The Proposal cites only one study whose findings suggest harm from 13(f) disclosures, and those to a distinct and limited group of hedge funds. This study found the investment pe rformance of these hedge funds declined after they began to file 13(f) disclosures.54 The affected hedge funds were characterized by an assortment of idiosyncratic features, including portfolios with more illiquid stock holdings, lower turnover rates, great er portfolio concentration, less conventional trading strategies, etc.55 Thus, even accepting that the 13(f) disclosures actually caused (and were not merely correlated with) declining investment performance, the question remains as to whether the experienc es of this unique group of hedge funds should be projected onto a larger pool of 13(f) filers and the extent, if at all, to base policymaking on those findings. Conclusion We do not support the Proposal’s recommendation to increase the reporting threshol ds for Form 13F to $3.5 billion from the current $100 million. We believe such a change would undermine market transparency that many investors, issuers, academics, and others have come to expect from these reports. We also contend that the purported cost savings to issuers are minimal in comparison with the costs to investors in lost information, and to the markets in terms of reduced trust, that are likely to come from the Proposals provisions.

The Commission should reconsider its misguided proposal to raise the reporting threshold under Form 13F for institutional investment managers. Such a decision would significantly obstruct transparency across publicly traded stocks and contradict the Commission’s stated mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. This proposal would raise the Form 13F reporting threshold by an astounding thirty five fold, from $100 million to $3.5 billion in eligible securities. Clearly this represents a very striking reduction in reporting requirements. The threshold change would by the Commission’s own estimates reduce filings from investment managers by 89.2%. This reduction would harm investors seeking to understand the ownership patterns and management influences of companies they own, issuers looking to engage their shareholders, academics and data providers who are able to conduct studies with the information provided, and the public and policy makers seeking to understand important public policy issues.

Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Thre shold for Institutional Investment Managers ( Release No. 3 4–89290 ; File No. S7–08–20). Dear Secretary Countryman : Better Markets1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the above -captioned rule proposal (“Release” or “Proposal” ) noticed for public comment by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”). The Release2 proposes to amend the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports used by institutional investment managers from the current $100 million to $3.5 billion. The Commission argues that since the threshold was set in 1975, the U.S. equities market has grown and that there are now more institutional investors that are subject to the $100 million trigger than in 1975. The Release also would inc rease the information provided by those institutional investment managers —those that have holdings above $3.5 billion —by eliminating the omission threshold for individual securities, and requiring the managers to provide additional identifying information. Finally, the Release would make certain technical amendments, including to modernize the structure of data reporting and amend the instructions on Form 13F for confidential treatment requests in light of a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.3 We oppose the 35-fold increase of the threshold. Our opposition is informed by a simple and compelling fact: the Commission lacks the authority to raise the threshold. Our letter will focus on this by presenting the complete legislative and regulatory hi story leading up to the enactment of the provisions that required the disclosure of Form 13F information. The Release omits material facts regarding this history, which creates a misrepresentation and misimpression of the Commission’s authority. Our letter a ims to correct this misimpression by providing the omitted facts. 1 Better Markets is a non -profit, non -partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street, and make our financial system work fo r all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies — including many in finance —to promote pro -market, pro -business, and pro -growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americans’ jobs, savings, retiremen ts, and more. 2 See, Release No. 34 –89290; File No. S7 –08–20, 85 Fed.

Securities and Exchange Commission Page 2 We also oppose the 35-fold increase —which would permit nearly 90% of current institutional investment managers to go dark —because it is patently anti -transparency .4 The information provided by institutional investment managers through the required disclosure of Form 13F (at the current $100 million threshold) is vital information necessary for investors to make informed investment decisions.5 The essential nature of that information is demonstrated by the fact that —out of the hundreds of forms that SEC’s EDGAR system hosts and makes available for download —Form 13F is the 6th most downloaded form.6 This information is also used by journalists, academics, third -party data, and information processors —all of which augment investors’ ability to make more informed decisions. The disclosure of that information also helps issuers to better engage their shareholders, which often could pre empt and prevent costly and unnecessary friction between shareholders and the management of an issuer. The information contained in Form 13F also helps regulators study , examine, punish, and deter trading practices by institutional investment managers (and the broker -dealers that serve them) t hat degrade market quality and harm investors. COMMENTS Commission Lacks the Authority to Increase the Threshold 35 -fold. The Notice Omits Several Material Facts Regarding the Legislative and Regulatory History that Mandated the Form 13F Disclosures . This Omission Creates a Misimpression of the Commission’s Authority. While the Commission is faithful in representing in the Release the enacted language of Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act as authorizing the Commission “to set reporting threshold in an amount of ‘at least $100,000,000 or such less er amount’ by rule”7 the Commission then proceeds to quote and re ly upon a Senate Banking Committee Report (that accompanied the Senate -passed version of the bill ) that states that the Commission would have “authority to raise or l ower the threshold .”8 The Release also states that another prov ision of the enacted law affords the Commission broad authority to exempt any institutional investment manager from the requirements of Section 13(f) of the Excha nge Act. The Commission cites these two sources: (1) the Senate Banking Committee Report language , and; (2) the provision that authorizes the Commission to exempt any institutional investment manager from the requirements of Section 13(f) as legal authority to increase the threshold 35 -fold. But the Release omits several material facts in representing the legislative and regulatory context that gave birth to the provisions requiring the 13F disclosures, and the Commission conveniently mis -reads the exemptiv e authority 4 See, generally, Commissioner Allisson Herren Lee ’s dissent outlining serious shortcomings of the Proposal, including the Commission ’s questionable use of its e xemptive autho rity (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 5 See, generally, Barbara Roper ’s Comment Letter in response to the Release , particularly pp. 3-8, on the usefulness of the Form 13F data , (September 1 6, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7777971 -223451.pdf . 6 See Comment Letter in response to the Release by Mary Barth, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University; Travis Dyer, SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University; Wayne Landsman, Kenan - Flagle r Business School, University of North Carolina; and Daniel J Taylor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania , (September 16, 2020) , available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7793920 -223568.pdf . 7 See Release at 46031. 8 See Release at 46031, and also Report to Accompany S.249, Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Sen. Rep. No. 94 -75, at p.107, 94th Cong ress, 1975 , available at https://bit.ly/3c2Endd . Securities and Exchange Commission Page 3 for self -serving reasons. Both these factors amount to a regulatory malpractice which alone should be grounds for the Commission to withdraw the Release. Commission Lacks Authority to Increase the Threshold. Section 13(f) is unambiguous in setting the threshold . The threshold applies to “every institutional investment manager …having an aggregate fair market value …of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine .”9 Nowhere else in the authorizing language does Congress suggest that the Commission may set the threshold higher than $100,000,000. Congress also set the direction that the Commission may go in changing the threshold, and that is only downwards , which would have increased the number of reporting entities. The following legislative and regulatory history only serves to reinforce this directive. Section 13(f) came about after an extensive study of the institutional investment industry. Starting 1968, Congress , in a joint -resolution , directed the Commission “to make a study and investigation of t he purchase, sale and holding of securities by institutional investors of all types in order to determine the effect of such purchases, sales and holdings upon the maintenance of fair and orderly securities markets , the stability of such markets , the inter ests of the issuers and upon the interests of the public .”10 This multi -year stud y culminated into a multi -volume report that detailed significant shortcoming s in the regulation of the institutional investment industry . The same study also highlighted information al gaps t hat prevent ed the Commission from more robustly regulating the markets. Among these recommendations were the request the Commission made to Congress to authorize the Commission to require the disclosure of the portfolio holdings of institutional investors. Three years following the transmittal of the “ Institutional Investor Study Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission ” to Congress , both the Senate and the House begun holding hearings on the matter. At a two -day hearing, the U.S. Senate Banking Com mittee ’s Subcommittee on Securities heard from several witness es, including then SEC Chairman Ray Garrett .11 On Tuesday, August 13, 1974 , in the room 5302 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the Subcommittee on Securities , Chaired by Senator Harrison Williams, gaveled the start of the hearings. Chairman Williams called the witnesses to order to discuss S. 2234 and S. 2683. He introduced the bills : “Both of these bills are designed to assure public disclosure of the securities holdi ngs and large equity transactions of institutional investors. Disclosure by institutional investors of their securities dealings is now generally recognized as being in the best interest of 9 See 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1) , emphasis added. 10 See Institutional Investor Study Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Summary Volume (March 10, 1971), at v ., available at https://bit.ly/348Wuuh . 11 Chairman Garrett was accompanied to the hearing by Harvey L. Pitt, Executive Assistant to the Chairman; Lee A. Pickard, Director, Division of Market Regulation; Allan S. Mostoff, Director, Division of Investment Management Regulation ; Francis R. Snodgrass, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation; and Martin E. Lybecker, Attorney in the Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Investment Management Regulation . Securities and Exchange Commission Page 4 the fair and orderly operation of the markets. This recognition i s apparent in the bipartisan support for these two bills. S. 2234 was introduced in July of last year by Senators Brooke, McIntyre, Proxmire, Tower, and me. S. 2683 was drafted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and introduced by Senators Brooke, Tower, and me at the SEC's request .”12 The two bills —again , one drafted by Chairman Williams and Senators Brooke, McIntyre, Proxmire, and Tower, and the other drafted by the SEC itself —pursued similar pro -transparency policies but , among other difference s, had significantly different threshold levels. The bill drafted by the Senators (S.2234) set the threshold at $10,000,000 (ten million dollars) for in stitutional investors, and $5,000,000 (five million dollars) for “any broker, dealer or exchange member with any trading or investment account ” that would be subject to disclosure requirements.13 Whereas the SEC -drafted bill (S.2683) excluded brokers and set the threshold to “at least $100 million, or such other amount not less than $10 mill ion as the Commission may by rule determine having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets .”14 Note here that the “or such other amount” language is replaced with “or such lesser amoun t” in the final, enacted legislation passed by both chambers . At the same hearing, Chairman Garrett discussed the di fferent thresholds , explaining that while he , as the Chairman of the SEC, prefers the SEC -drafted version (setting the threshold at $100 million in contrast with the Senate -drafted version which set the threshold at $10 million ), he nonetheless stat ed that that threshold is a starting point and “if we should later discover that we need to expand our database for our own purposes or for the information of the public, we would have the authority to do so .”15 Note that his use of “expand our database” meant requiring the disclosure of holdings by more institutional investors by lowering the triggering threshold from $100 million. In othe r words, Chairman Garrett testified that the Commission sympathizes with the Senators’ policy goals of requiring the disclosure of 13F information by many more institutional investors (which would have been accomplished by setting the threshold at $10 million) but requested to have flexibility in gradually lowering the threshold from $100 million , as needed. Chairman Garrett was not alone in foreseeing the possibility of requiring the disclosure of 13F information from more institutional investors ( i.e. those that hold less than $100 million in securities) . His c olleague, Commissioner Philip Loomis and Commission’s staff also anticipated that as the 13F information proves its usefulness, the Commission may require the disclosure from more institutional investors. At a September 13, 1974 , hearing before the House Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance, Commissioner Loomis —referring to the House companion bill (H.R.13986) to the SEC - drafted S. 2683 —discussed the $100 million threshold echoing the words of Chairman Garrett and 12 See Institutional Investors Full Disclosure Act (S.2234 and S.2683) , Hea rings Before Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs , United States Senate, 93rd Congress, 2nd Session (August 13 -14, 1974) , p.1, available at https://bit.ly/3kZxFI1 (“Senate H earing”) . 13 See Senate Hearing , p.4. 14 See Senate Hearing , p.11. 15 See Chairman Garrett’s testimony, Senate Hearing , pp.21 -22. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 5 said, “if we should later discover that we need to expand our data base for our own purposes or for the information of the public, we would have the authority to do so, within specified limitations. ”16 During the same hearing , the following exchange t ook place between the Sub committee ’s staff Mr. Charles Curtis and Commissioner Loomis: Mr. Curtis: You indicate on [page 8 of your testimony] or at least create t he impres sion that additional persons will be called upon for reports only if the Commission should later discover that it needs to expand this data base. It is a suggestion to me that the Commission does not intend to set that portfolio level at a lesser amount, although the statute would authorize you to take it down to a $10 million trigger. Is that a correct impression from your comments? Mr. Loo mis: I believe that is correct. I think we will start with the $100 million which will sweep in by no means t he whole population but the majority or a substantial majority of the amounts of holdings involved. Then, if we discover as a result of experience we need to go further, we will. To start, we wouldn't want to expand the job before we begin it.17 Later, in another exchange between Mr. Curtis and Commissioner Loomis, Mr. Curtis re - affirms the Committee ’s understanding that were the Commission to change the thresholds that trigger reporting, the Commission would only go in the direction that expands the database and increases the number of reporters. In th e exchange , Mr. Curtis asks to Commissioner Loomis , “You have already indicated that the Commission's cur rent intention is to leave the program operative at the $100 million portfolio level depending on a subsequent determination as to whether the data base needs to be expande d. Has the Commission made a similar determination in estimating whether it will require these re ports at more frequent intervals than a quarterly basis, or has there been any determination as to what will be the frequency of reporting called for? ” To which, Mr. Loomis responds, “I think we would star t with a quarterly basis and see what we get and find out whether some of it should be provided more often, depending on the nature of it. ”18 In this hearing Finally , as further indication that th e $100 million threshold could only change in the direction that increases the number of institutional invest ors that must disclose 13F information , Commissioner Loomis submitte d for the House Subcommittee hearing a Memorandum prepared by the Commission ’s staff that , among other analysis , includ ed the following statement : “The Commission would be given rule -making authority to reduce the $100 million test, but in no case to an amount les s than $10 million, having given reasonable consideration to the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the fair and equitable 16 See Institutional Disclosure And Sales of Investment Company Advisers (H.R.10 570 and H.R.13986), Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives , 93rd Congress, 2nd Session (September 13, 1974) , p.27, available at https://bit.ly/3cFwef1 (“House Hearing ”). 17 See House Hearing , p.44 18 See House Hearing , pp.44-45. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 6 treatment of affected persons .”19 Neither in this staff memo nor in the rest of the Senate or House hearings, t here is any indication by Members of Congress (or their staff) or Commissioner s (or Commis sion staff) that the Commission is authorized to raise the reporting threshold above $ 100 million. To sum -up: Congres sional managers of the 1 3F disclosure bills ; their staff ; SEC Chairman and at least one other Commissioner , and, finally ; SEC staff , all unders tood that the $100 million is a starting point, and should that threshold undergo any changes, the only direction the Commission is authorized to go is the one that increases the number of reporters . Given this history, and the fact that the Senate wanted to set the threshold at $10 million (ten million) while the Commission requested $100 million ( hundred million) it is no surprise that during the Conference that reconciled ma ny differences among multiple other bills that comprised the Securities Act Amendments of 1975 , the operative lang uage for the Section 13(f) threshold changed f rom the (SEC -preferred) “at least $100 million, or such other amount not less than $10 million as the Commission may …” to “at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commissio n, by rule, may determine ….” This latter language became the law and has remained unchanged since 1975. The Commission is Misreading and Mis representing the Exemptive Authority As noted above, in addition to the Senate Report language ,20 the Commission in the Release also cites the general exemptive authority under Section 13(f)(3) that—in the view of the Commission —grants the Commission authorit y to exempt nearly 90% of current institutional investors from the 1 3F disclosures. Given the legislative and regulatory history laid out in the preceding pages o f this letter, it is preposter ous to suggest that Congress passed a law requiring disclosure of certain information from (then) over three hundred entities21 but somehow also authorized the Commission to cut that number down to 30, should the Commission feel like it. The legislative history supports our contention and disagree s with the Commission ’s current reading of the 1 3(f)(3) exemptive autho rity. At the August 13, 1974 , Senate hearing noted above, Senator Wallace Benne tt had the following exchange with SEC Chairman Garrett : “Senator Bennett: It has been suggested that accounts over which a bank has no investment discretion, such as the custodial accounts, should be exempt from reporting. Do you have any comment? Mr. Garrett: If it has no investment authority or responsibility and gives no investment advice, then I would say yes. ”22 19 See House Hearing , p.29. 20 See fn. 8, supra. 21 See, for example, House Hearing, p.44, noting that the disclosure requireme nts would apply to 300 separate entities. 22 See Senate Hearing, p.39. Securities and Exchange Commission Page 7 These and similar underst anding of the exemptive authority —that limits the use of such authority to particular facts and circumstances —were also expressed by various industry representatives over the course of the two days of the Senate hearings .23 At the September 1 3, 1974, House hearing noted above, the Commission ’s staff —in their memorandum that analyzed the differences between the S .2683 ( i.e., SEC-drafted bill) and the H.R.13986 —explained the need for the exemptive authority and the kinds of circumstances under which such authority may be used. The Commission memorandum reads : “H.R. 13986 pro vides exemptive authority to the Commission with respect to persons defined as investment managers as a class. S. 2683 would provide such exemptive authority over any investment manager, any security, any class of investment managers or any class of securities. The omission in H.R. 13986 of exemptive authority over any individual manager, any security or any class of securities may raise awkward problems. One of the potential problems which is not precisely foresee able is th at, since the security holdings reporting provisions are drafted broadly in an effort to include all securities holdings, it is quite possible that certain securities holdings may be of little or no interest to the Commission and to the public, and the Com mission may wish to delete such securities from the holdings reporting provisions. For example, it may be desirable to exempt the securities of foreign issuers held by foreign institutions. Therefore, it would be desirable to change that exemptive authorit y to include authority ever any investment man ager, any security, or any class of securities. ”24 Nothing else in th e legislation and regulato ry history we have examined suggest that Congress or th e Commission expected or unders tood tha t the Section 13f (3) exemptive authority would permit the Commission to reduce the number o f entities that disclose 13F in formation by nearly 90%. *** Other than a half-a-sentence mention ing of the Commission’s 1968 -71 study, the Release omits the entire legislative and regulatory history recounted above. This omission of material facts and analys es creates a misimpression of the Commission ’s authority to change the threshold , which amounts to a regulatory malpractice . Conclusion The Co mmission must withdraw this patently anti -transparency and anti -investor Proposal. Given t he legislative and regulatory backdrop recounted above , we reiterate that the Commission 23 See Senate Hearing, p. 68; p.70; p.75; p.78; p.202, etc. 24 See Commission ’s memorandum reproduced in the House Hearing, p. 30 (emphasis added) . Securities and Exchange Commission Page 8 lacks the authority to raise the threshold 35 -fold and the Commission would be abusing the exemptive authority found under Section 13 (f)(3) if it do es so .

How could you even be considering reducing disclosures by large investors with the potential to move markets? Compliance costs to file a 13F are negligible to a $100 million fund, which is the minimum size required to report. 13F's are a critical source of information to market participants on the holdings of the largest investment managers that provide insight impacting my individual portfolios. They do not put funds at any disadvantage given the 45 day period that elapses before filing 13-F's after the end of each quarter. Instead, you are seeking to remove important information from individual investors and academics at a time when you should be seeking to improve transparency to protect individual investors. I strongly encourage you to keep the current rules intact and not adopt rules that reduce disclosures by key market participants."
Sumit Gupta,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223894.htm,,"Sep. 30, 2020 Subject: File No. S7-08-20 From: Sumit Gupta -------------------------- September 30, 2020 I am opposed to the proposed change, and instead favor of keeping the current $100M rule for 13F reporting. As an individual investor managing and investing money for my family, I'm in favor of more transparency rather than less. I think the argument that people copy cat fund positions from 13F is unfair. Most fundamentally based managers have plenty of time to establish a position before it gets reported in a 13F. Most of these managers are not buying and selling within months, but instead they would like to hold for years ideally. In fact more eyeballs on these stocks instead helps these stocks get more interest which eventually translates into more flows into these stocks and thus better price discovery. All of this is especially true for micro, nano, smaller and mid cap companies. If certain funds are trading in and out on a less than quarterly time-frame, then their 13Fs are useless to the long term investor and the argument about copycatting is invalid. Passive investing flows into market cap weighted ETFs, also flows into the SPX and NDX from 401ks have started to distort the market where everyone needs to own the same large cap stocks and FAANG stocks. Its just a big crowded trade, and if you happen to be a popular large cap then you keep getting bought by these flows. By giving access to 13F for smaller funds which actually do real fundamental research and even activism, it allows for more efficient price discovery for micro/smaller/mid cap public companies. Fund managers and individual investors can see what their favorite fund managers are buying which allows for greater price discovery. It also helps the individual investor direct their energies and time to research certain stocks even further. It helps the fund manager if the broader market also participates and starts buying these stocks. That is why so many fund managers are pitching stocks at investment conferences or in their quarterly fund letters. Another benefit is skin-in-the-game and alignment. Many fund managers are releasing quarterly letters talking about and pitching their investment thesis on different stocks. Same thing for many public platforms like Twitter Seeking Alpha, Stocktwits and plenty of stock forums where fund managers discuss investment ideas frequently. I would like to confirm by checking a 13F whether or not what they discussing is real or not. For an individual investor checking 13Fs is the only way for me to verify what managers are saying is in their portfolio. In the end I think the proposed rule will have the opposite consequence of what is actually intended and might make smaller fund managers struggle even more as no one even buys the same stocks as them. So please keep 13F disclosure as it is at $100M. If the idea is to create less compliance burden/cost for fund managers then I think a better way is to modernize the SEC website so the online forms could be easily filled/saved instead. The focus should be on improving the digital/IT infrastructure to make it easier for fund managers rather than increasing the AUM threshold. Please aspire towards more transparency in markets rather the less."

I feel strongly that the proposal to increase the minimum AUM to be required to file form 13F would reduce market transparency and harm investors. My reasons are as follows: Filing costs to managers are negligible and in my experience much lower than those described in the proposal; “Front-running” based on 13F filings is largely a non-issue as the information is 45-days old at best, which leaves enough time to all but the biggest managers to complete their trades; Due diligence and transparency would be dramatically reduced: 13Fs provide a very useful tool when researching and monitoring investment managers. The proposal would reduce the numbers of managers filing by about 90% according to current estimates; Companies would see much reduced information about their shareholder base, particularly smaller companies.

"Kelly Reisdorf, Chief Investor Relations and Communications Office, Vista Outdoor, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860157-223925.pdf,,"1 September 8, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Vista Outdoor (NYSE: VSTO), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets, h eadquartered in of Anoka, Minnesota , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company. The proposed rule, if enacted, would result in less effective engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and materially weaken the robustness and quality of our trading surveillance data, which has proven invaluable to us to better understand and work with our shareholder bas e. 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company . While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data we have illustrating “street name” investors buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research /triangulation efforts . While Vista Out door has the scale to support investments in surveillance data, many small -cap issuers are unable to make the same level of commitment, placing even greater reliance on the completeness and transparency of 13F filings to support effective investor engagement programs . We do not believe the Commission has properly considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and its impact on our ability to effectively engage with our investors throughout the y ear. Operating at an approximate $1.13B market cap , we are particularly concerned at how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify and monitor changes in ownership amongst our largest shareholders. Based on our current shareholder base, we estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would result in an overall 23% loss of transparency based on total shares outstanding. On an absolute basis, approximately 78 out of 210 fil ers currently disclosing ownership of Vista 2 Outdoor common stock would be exempt from filings under the proposal , effectively reducing visibility by approximately 37% of total filers. See below table for details as reference. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency At Vista Outdoor, we take shareholder engagement very seriously , and believe that receiving regular feedback from our largest shareholders is key to our long -term success . Our company leverages 13F data to allocate scarce CEO/CFO and other senior executive time to investor meetings . We would lose visibility in to the ownership of over 21% of our total shares outstanding under the Commission’s proposal . Since it is not feasible for us to grant every request; our IR engagement program must g ive priority to our largest shareholders and also towards targeting/outreach initiatives underway . If the Commission’s proposed changes are adopted, our ability to identify and prioritize smaller holders of our common stoc k for engagement would be significantly reduced. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholde rs and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively identify, engage with and attract stable, long -term investors in our common stock. By hindering this effort, the Commission’s proposal could potentially deprive us of the perspective and stability that new long-term investors bring to the table, as well as make it more difficult for us to raise growth capital should we need to do so in the future. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the glob al COVID -19 pandemic.1 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our 1 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes o n particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to 3 need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of short -term share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions . The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short -term-oriented fund managers . Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls u nder the $3.5 billion threshold is building a position in our common stock until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. While we agree that SEC should modernize its own ership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impact s of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in th e gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,2 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status .3 For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .4 make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . ..

Raising the $100 million threshold at which investment managers need to disclose their equity holdings to $3.5 billion is a bad idea. Transparency of institutional investor activities is essential for market integrity. 1 All opinions are strictly my own and do not necessarily represent those of Georgetown University or anyone else. Over the years I have served as a Visiting Academic Fellow at the NASD, served on the boards of the EDGX and EDGA exchanges, served as Chair o f the Nasdaq Economic Advisory Board, and performed consulting work for brokerage firms, stock exchanges, market makers, and law firms . I’ve also visited over 75 stock and derivative exchanges around the world. As a finance professor, I practice what I p reach in terms of diversification and own modest holdings in most public companies, including brokers, asset managers, market makers, and exchanges. 2 2. The proposed $3.5 billion threshold amount is too high. Letting billion -dollar hedge funds act in the dark is a bad idea. 3. Dropping nearly 10% of assets from the light of day will harm academic studies of the impact of institutional investors. 4. The SEC should clarify that “holdings” includes short positions as well as long positions. 5. Form 13F fil ings should include OTC stocks as they did when Rule 13(f) -1 was first adopted. 6. The Proposing Release overstates SEC authority . The s tatute explicitly states “o r such lesser amount ” not “or such other amount.” This was a conscious amendment made to the law during the legislative process to remove the SEC’s authority to increase the threshold. 7. Congress amended the authorizing sentence in 13(f) in 2010 and chose to leave the threshold at “$100,000,000 or such lesser amount.” Thus 2010, not 1975 , would be the proper base year for any adjustment. 8. Look for other ways to reduce costs and burdens. Form NPORT -P filers sho uld be exempt because Form 13F is mostly redundant to NPORT -P. Introduction In 1975, Congress passed the National Market System amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.2 Among many other substantial changes, the amendments required institutional investors managing more than $100 million to report their holdings in securities registered with the SEC .3 The SEC implemented this filing requirement with Rule 13(f) -1 that requires such institutional investors to report their equity holdings on Form 13F.4 2 Public Law 94 -29 3 As amended by Dodd -Frank in 2010, §13(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 19 34 now reads: Every institutional investment manager which uses the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in the course of its business as an institutional investmen t manager and which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) or otherwise becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of any security of a class described in subsection (d)(1) upon the purchase or sale of a security -based swap that the Commission may define by rule, having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may d etermine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event sh all such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. 4 See SEC Release No. 34 -14852 ,43 FR 26700, June 22,1978. 3 The SEC is proposing to raise the reporting threshold from $100 m illion to $3.5 b illion, a 34,000% increase. This would release approximately 4,500 money managers, each of whom controls over $100 million dollars in assets, from their legal obligation to report to the public what they are doing. These money managers collectively manage over $2.3 trillion in assets, 9.2% of the assets currently reported on Form 13F.5 Transparency is essential to maintaining market integrity. This proposal would let billion -dollar hedge funds avoid disclosure. As reported in Bloomberg, this means that funds run by people such as George Soros and other controversial hedge fund managers would avoid disclosure.6 By reducing transparency for smaller funds, this proposal makes it harder for potential investors to do their due diligence on smaller institutional investors.7 By examining 13F f ilings, potential investors can see whether the actual investment history of a manager is consistent with its marketing material. Eliminating 13F transparency for 4,500 investment managers will also make it harder for potential invest ors to detect fraud b y investment managers .8 Issuers depend upon 13F filings as the only way that they can find out who their street name shareholders are. One small company es timated that 46% of its 13F -disclosed shareholders would avoid disclosure under the proposed rule .9 Issuers state that 13F data are essential for their shareholder engagement.10 The reduction in reporting of institutional positions will also make it harder for analysts to track “crowded trades” in which too many institutions have piled into a single idea.11 Crowded trades often end badly when too many investors run for the exit at the same time, so identifying crowded trades is important for alerting investors of the risk. 5 The Proposing Release can be found at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf 6 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-14/tepper -einhorn -soros -stock -holdings -would -go-dark-in-sec- plan 7 See the comment letter from Sarah Metzgar at Talson Capital Management, https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08- 20/s70820 -7415009 -219283.htm 8 See the comment letter from Doron Cohen at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415172 - 219344.htm 9 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7644287 -222350.pdf 10 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7741257 -223138.pdf 11 See https:// www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020 -07-20/goldman -warns -sec-proposal -could -shroud -hedge - fund-crowding 4 13F filings provide great amounts of useful information . For example, 13F data are now demonstrating which institutional investors are investing in bitcoin, data that may soon disapp ear if the proposed rule is adopted.12 The instantaneous outpouring of opposition to this proposal expressed in the comment letters is strong evidence that the public interest is to increase, not decrease, transparency into the activities of institutional investors. As one commentator has al ready pointed out: “When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of securities markets. Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets. If only they had the same confidence in US regulators. ”13 13F filings are not unduly burdensome on smaller asset managers. All 13F requires is a list of assets. Such lists are at the fingertips of every asset manager, no matter how large or small. As RockCreek Group noted, “However, it is worth pointing out that over the nearly two decades that we have been in existence, not once has any of our smaller managers raised the 13F filing requirements as burdensome with the potential to stifle future growth — including new managers with as little as $250 million under management.”14 The proposed threshold is too high and the logic is nonsensical. The real question is “At what size threshold do the benefits to society of better disclosure outweigh the costs ?” The Proposing R elease makes no attempt to figure this out. There is some bleating that disclosing holdings is somehow costly to managers, as well as some conveniently expanded estimates of compliance costs. Let us examine these two factors. First, the Proposing Release states that disclosure may be costly to the funds as other investors could guess what the fund would do in the future and “front run” them, pushing up the cost of doing trades in 12 https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/08/06/valuable -sec-data-on-20-institutional -bitcoin - investors -could -soon -disappear 13 Comment letter of Daniel Farao, https ://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7415705 -219424.htm 14 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7787361 -223531.pdf 5 the future. The proposition that the information revealed in Form 13F harms filers due to front running is quite weak. The 45-day time lag between the end of the quarter and the required filing date is more than enough time to complete most institutional trades , elimin ating the risk of front running . Even large orders relative to the average daily volume can usually be executed within a week or two, so 45 days is more than enough time for a manager to complete a trade. The SEC could easily reduce this window without causing substantial harm to filers. As documented in Christoff ersen et al (2018), managers make use of the 45 day lag and wait an average of 37 days to file.15 Their paper documents that smaller funds actually take less time to file than larger funds, in dicating that they may be less concerned about front running or copycatting than large r funds. Indeed, the notion that a manager’s forthcoming trades are so large that they could move the market is a strong argument that the manager is large enough that disclosure should be required. The whole reason for the various §13 disclosure requirements stem s from the large power of institutional investors and the need for transparency to spotlight any abuses. Moreover, if a manager does believe that they will be harmed by the disclosure, there is a process for requesting confidential treatment. Second, t he notion that Form 13F is burdensome is a critique o f its implementation by the SEC. In theory, complying with the §13(f) disclosure requirements should be simple. Every asset manager must produce position reports for its internal purposes including ris k management, as well as position reports for its investors. This can usually be done at the touch of a button. Often these reports can be generated in real -time during the trading day . There is no reason why submitting such a report to the SEC as well as to fund management should be a difficult or burdensome endeavor. Manager s already have the data at their fingertips. The only thing that could be burdensome is the SEC’s form. If compliance costs are an issue, the SEC should examine ways of streamlin ing the filing process. The logic in the proposing release is that the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies has purportedly grown by a factor of approximately 35 since 1975, so the threshold should increase by the same amount. That mak es no sense. The real question is “How big does a manager have to be before their trading can have a major impact on the market?” Institutional investors with $100 million under management can still have a major impact on companies with their trading, es pecially on smaller and midcap companies. 15 This excellent paper was cited in the Proposing Release. See Susan E.K. Christoffersen, Erfan Danesh, and David Musto, Why Do Institutions Delay Their Shareholdings? Evidence from Form 13F , (Working Paper, June 11, 2018) (“Christoffersen, Danesh and Mus to”), available at https://www.bwl.uni - mannheim.de/media/Lehrstuehle/bwl/Area_Finance/Finance_Area_Seminar/HWS2018/Christoffersen_Paper.pdf It should be noted that this paper does not document any quantitative harm from front running or copycatting, only t hat managers make use of the time available for filing. 6 Dropping almost 10% of assets will harm studies of the impact of institutional investors. 13(f) data are widely used in academic studies on a variety of topics . Such data are essential for empir ical studies that need to control for the extent of institutional ownership. The proposed increase in the threshold, by the SEC’s own data, remove from public eye ownership data on almost 9.2 % of the existing data. 16 A brief search of the Social Science Research Netw ork (SSRN) identifies over 1,400 academic papers that refer to 13(f) data.17 A Google Scholar search on “SEC 13(f) institutional holdings ” yields “about 195,000 results.”18 The SEC proposal is out of step with global trends in disclosure. The SEC is proposing to increase the thres hold for disclosure by 34,000%. This ignores the global trend in other countries to decrease, not increase, the disclosure threshold.19 OTC stocks should be included in the list of 13F securities . One thing that puzzles me is why the official list of Section 13F securities leaves out OTC stocks. The statutory definition of the required securities specified in 13(d)(1) includes “ any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to section 12 of this title. ” Th ere are many companies that are SEC registrants under Section 12 and which should be in the official 13F list but are not , as they are traded OTC and not listed on exchanges . The explanation lies in the obsolete language of SEC Rule 13f -1. Rule 13f -1 specifies that securities “quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association ” should be included on the 13F list.20 This wording goes back to the original promulgation of the rule back in 1978.21 That meant that NASDAQ -listed s ecurities were on the list. In those days, NASDAQ was not an exchange but a registered securities association that provided quotes for the OTC market .22 Thus, the 13F list originally covered virtually all equities traded in the United States, both exchang e-listed and OTC. 16 See the table on page 17 of the Proposing Release. 17 www.ssrn.com 18 https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=SEC+13%28f%29+institutional+holdings&btnG= 19 See Schouten, Michael C., and Mathias M. Siems. ""The evolution of ownership disclosure rules across countries."" Journal of Corpo rate Law Studies 10.2 (2010): 451 -483. 20 17 CFR § 240.13f -1 21 43 FR 26705 22 At the time, NASDAQ was an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system. Today, Nasdaq is not an acronym and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., i s no longer owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers (now FINRA). 7 Gradually, our markets evolved. Today, Nasdaq is a national stock exchange with high listing standards. Over the years it raised its listing standards multiple times, shedding many companies along the way.23 The over -the-counter marke ts have evolved and now entities such as OTC Markets perform the same function that NASDAQ did in 1978. OTC stocks are now quoted on the OTC Market, which is not a registered securities association. Thus, many OTC -quoted SEC registrants are not included in this list, despite the clear statutory requirement that they should be. The SEC should fix this omission and follow the law. As the original rule had anything quoted on a national securities association, the rule should be updated to include any equ ity security issued a ticker symbol by a registered securities association (i.e. FINRA. ) Here is a suggestion for updating Rule 13(f) -1 with additions underlined and deletions struck out : (c) For purposes of this rule “section 13(f) securities” shall mean equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of the Act that are admitted to trading on a national securities exchange or have a ticker symbol issued by quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association. Including OTC stocks on the 13F list will bring increased transparency into the ownership of these companies . This will help the issuers in this segment have a better understanding of who their shareholders are, and it will help investors to know who their co -investors are. It will also increase institutional ownership in this segment by highlighting the instit utional ownership of other investors, and thus increase investment in small -cap companies quoted on the OTC market. It is thus in the public interest to increase such transparency into the ownership of OTC -traded companies. Modernizing 13F in this way wi ll simplify the creation of the 13F list: If it has a ticker symbol, it’s on the list and holdings need to be disclosed. This could actually reduce compliance costs. There will be no need to sift through all of the OTC -traded stocks to figure out which ones are or are not on the list. This will also simplify compliance by money managers with an easily understood criteria for the 13F list. While we are on the topic of 13F … 13F filings should include short as well as long holdings . The SEC’s current FAQ guidance for Form 13F contain explicit instruction s to NOT report short positions in equities or options.24 This is a mistake that should be corrected. There is no reason the transparency requirements in 13(f) should not apply equally to short as wel l as long holdings. The same public interest concerns about the activities of institutional investors apply equally to the short side as the long side of their holdings. Indeed, given the potential for manipulative short selling , the public interest 23 Most notably in 1990 (56 FR 44108) and 1997 (62 FR 45895) 24 See questions 41 and 43 of the FAQ at https ://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm . 8 conc erns are even stronger for short positions. In addition to price manipulation, short selling can also be used to manipulate corporate governance through “empty voting” in shareholder votes.25 Better disclosure of short positions would make it easier to detect such behavior, which currently is extremely difficult to detect. It should be noted that the European Union has a lower threshold for reporting short positions than long positions.26 Nevertheless, the Commission has repeatedly turned a deaf ear to the repeated pleas of issuers, exchanges, and investors for better transparency around short selling.27 The SEC should amend its Form 13F FAQ guidance to clarify that holdings includes short holdings as well as long holdings. FAQs generally don’t go through the notice and comment process, so this can be done quickly and easily. The SEC’s traditional Form 13F guidance i s a mistaken interpretation of the statute as well as of the more recent will of Congress . The statute speaks of “holdings” and requires reports for “each such equity security held.” Given a lack of an official statutory definition of “security held,” it is certainly within the Commissions interpretive power to interpret “holdings” as the contents of a portfolio, not just the long positions. This is indeed the common understanding of the phrase. For example, Investopedia defines holding as , “Holdings ar e the contents of an investment portfolio held by an individual or entity, such as a mutual fund or a pension fund.”28 Short positions are clearly part of the contents of a portfolio. Here is another example of how the word “hold” is commonly understoo d in the financial world. Interactive Brokers regularly sends me a list of insider purchases and sales in securities I hold . Here is an excerpt from a recent email they sent me : 25 A manipulator who wanted to affect the outcom e of a shareholder vote could go long in one account and then hedge the position either by short selling in another account or through derivatives. For example, a bad actor with a large position in one firm, c ould engage in empty voting to disrupt a competitor of tha t firm, such as through blocking a value -enhancing merger. 26 The EU requires short positions greater than 0.1% to be reported to regulators and greater than 0.5% to be reported publicly. See https://www.esma.europa.eu/regulation/trading/short -selling . 27 See for example, various petitions for rulemaking including https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2020/petn4 - 758.pdf , https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2017/petn4 -712.pdf , https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 - 691.pdf , and https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf . It is curious that the Commission has refused to act on these numerous reasonable pleas, while it is engaging in unnecessary and harmful rulemakings like this one. 28 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdings.asp 9 The table provided by Interactive Brokers includes insider purchases and sales in securities in which I hold a short position, not just the securities in which I hold a long position. The SEC should accept that the standard financial usage of the word “holdings” includes both long and short posit ions and modify the instructions to Form 13F to explicitly include short positions. Here is yet another example. There is a class of mutual funds known as long -short funds that engage in short selling. Like most mutual funds, most of these mutual fun ds put out fact sheets that provide useful information about the funds. I did a search on mutualfund.com and identified 30 long-short funds with more than $115 million in assets. Of these 30 long-short funds , 23 of them explicitly included short positions as “holding s” on their fact sheets or on their web sites . None of them posted only long positions as holdings, except for one fund which only posted its largest holdings which all happened to be long. Thus, it is a common usage in financial markets to include short positions as well as long positions when discussing holdings. The SEC’s own instructions for Form N -Q also treat short positions as holdings. The SEC’s directions to exclude short holdings from Form 13F is even more puzzling given that the instructi ons to Form N -Q (Quarterly Schedule of Portfolio Holdings o f Registered Management Investment Company ) call for the complete schedule of investments.29 Thus, the SEC itself uses the common financial usage of “holdings” to refer to both long and short positions. The SEC should be consistent and revise the guidance for Form 13F to explicitly include short positions. 29 https://www.sec.gov/files/formn -q.pdf 10 Option positions equivalent to shor t equity holdings are already included in 13F requirements . Another reason to report short positions is that some short equity exposures are already included in Form 13F. Options are clearly included in the official list of 13F securities.30 Indeed, her e is a sample from t he latest list as of this writing : It is well known from “European Put -Call Parity” that a long position in a put option has the same payoff and is economically equivalent to the payoff from a combination of shorting the stock and owning a call . It is common sense that , if one type of position is included in the disclosure , then an economically equivalent position should also be included. Thus, short equity positions should be included in 13F filings just as long put options are required. Similarly, short option positions should also be included in the disclosures. Dodd -Frank expanded 13(f), so a reinterpretation is within the recent intent of the law. Congress amended 13(f) in 2010 to include “purchase or sale of a security -based swap ” in defining the assets under management that would be counted for the $100 million threshold. This indicates Congressional thinking that long and short positions, as well as derivatives, should be counted by its use of the words (emphasis added) “purchase or sale .” Even if the Commission’s overly narrow interpretation of 13(f) w ere somehow defensible prior to Dodd -Frank, it be came less defensible after Congress added its intention to count long and short swap transactions. The Commission should update the instructions and FAQ to Form 13F as part of its Dodd -Frank housekeeping. 30 https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13f/13flist2020q2.pdf 11 Congress did NOT give the SEC authority to raise the reporting threshold. As Commissioner Lee made clear in her eloquent statement, the enabling statute “provides no support for increasing the threshold.”31 You should listen to her. She is right. The plain text is clear: Congress set a threshold of “at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) ”. The text does not say “or such other amount” or “or such greater amount.” When Senator Williams introduced Senate Bill 249 that would become the 1975 amendments that established 13(f) , he stated that the SEC would indeed have authority to raise or lower the limit . In his words, “The SEC would have rulemaking authority to raise or lower the $100 million jurisdictional amount…” 32 Here are his remarks from the Congressional Record: The original language in S249 did in fact contain the phrase “or such other amount.” Again, here is the submission of the original S249 in the Congressional Record: 31 https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10 32 Congressional Record, January 17, 1975 S437 12 However, the final law that was passed did not include the phrase “or such other amount.” Congressman Staggers ’ amendment in the H ouse contained the l anguage “such lesser amount”, which was the language chosen for the final law. This amendment process is clear evidence that Congress intentionally and thoughtfully chose whether or not to give the SEC statutory authority to raise the threshold. Congre ss intentionally gave the SEC the authority to lower but not to raise the threshold. It remains to be seen how broadly the exemptive authority found in §13(f)(3) and §36 (a)(1) applies in this case when Congress clearly decided to withhold authority to increase the threshold . The Commission would have to demonstrate that such “ such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. ”33 This will be hard to do as this proposal seriously we akens the protection of investors. It is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest. Removing transparency from 90% of the previously required filers with such dubious justification is arbitrary and capricious. The current proposal to inc rease the threshold by a factor of 35 will not withstand a court challenge. A 34,000% increase in the reporting threshold is not in the public interest or consistent with the intent of the section. Indeed, it clearly goes against Congress conscious decision not to give the SEC authority to raise the limit. 33 Securities Exchange Act §36(a)(1) 13 Congress chose not change the threshold in 2010. Additional evidence against raising the threshold comes from the fact that Congress effectively reaffirmed the $100 million threshold in 2010 when it passed Dodd -Frank . At that time , Congress amended the exact sentence that contains the threshold to include equity positions based on the purchase or sale of securities based swaps. Given that Congress amended that very sentence in 2010, it stands to reason that Congress considered the entire sentence and consciously chose not to change the “$100,000,000 or such lesser amount ” threshold. The correct base year , if any, is 2010, not 1975. Unlike many other areas in Dodd -Frank , Con gress did NOT see fit to add an inflation escalation clause to the threshold . In Dodd -Frank, Congress added several inflation escalation clauses include for the definition of an exempt commercial purchase, SIPC protection, expedited funds availability, Truth in Lending Act, and the qualified client definition.34 Congress could have added an inflation escalation clause when they amended that sentence but chose not to . Once again, Congress examined and edited the sentence establishing the threshold in 2010 . This means that the year 2010 was the year that Congress last examined and approved the $100 million figure. For that reason, the correct base year for any escalation , assuming , contrary to fact , that the SEC has statutory authority to raise the threshold , should be 2010, not 1975. For the record, over this period the CPI rose 17.65 % and the S&P500 155%. This would imply thresholds of $118 or $255 million, respectively. There are better ways to reduce reporting burdens. SEC should examine other means of reducing burdens. In particular, the information on Form 13F is mostly redundant to the material in Form NPORT -P. Exempting all NPORT -P filers would remove from them this redundant filing obligation. The SEC and the data vendors who utilize 13(f) data can easily grab the data off of NPORT -P filings which are in XML. Summary REDUCING TRANPARENCY IS A BAD IDEA . JUST SAY NO. BETTER YET, INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY INCLUDING SHORT HOLDINGS AND OTC STOCKS. We should increase, not decrease, transparency in the market by requiring the reporting of short holdings and by expanding the 13F list to include OTC stocks. 34 See Dodd Frank section s 527, 929H, 1086, 1100E, 418, 14 Respectfully submitted, James J.

Transparency within the market will be reduced and it will be very difficult to see how shareholders/funds/management are buying and selling. These forms cost very little to complete but provide a ton of information to the public, primarily people in the top 1% or funds that could have a major impact on stock prices. Worst of all, this proposal goes against the stated SEC mission. With the stated mission of ""The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. The SEC strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public's trust."" There is no way this proposal is in alignment with that mission. This proposal just shows how much the SEC is in bed with hedge funds and other prominent investors. It no longer protects smaller investors, academics, or the public. Reject this proposal!

Reynolds, President and Chief Executive Officer, Putnam Investments",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860057-223908.pdf,,"Via electronic mail ( rule-comment@sec.gov ) September 29, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Th reshold for Institutional Investment Managers , File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: Founded in 1937, Putnam Investments is a leadi ng global money management firm with approximately $ 182 billion in assets under management as of August 31, 2020 . Putna m provides inves tment management services to both individ ual investors – primarily through their financial advisors – as well as to institutional investors worldwide. Putnam manages over 100 mutual funds and 60 institutional strategies across a range o f asset cl asses and investment styles. Putnam is a sponsor of four closed -end funds regist ered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. At September 27, 2020 Putnam had $ 1.8 billion in closed -end fund assets under management. Putnam welcomes the opportun ity to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with comments on the proposal to raise the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institut ional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion (the “Proposal ”).1 Putnam understands the desire of the SEC to update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by insti tutional investment managers for the first time in 45 years to reflect the change in size and structure of the U.S. equities market since 1975 . How ever, we believe th at the sizeable increase in the reporting thre shold would have a detrimental effect on closed - end fund s and their sponsors by exempting a number of instit utional inve stment managers that are leading closed -end fund activists from reporting ob ligations on F orm 13F. We believ e that Form 13F reports p rovide closed -end f unds with valuable insights into the accumulation of positions in closed -end fund s by activi sts that are below the 5% threshold for reporting on Schedule 13D or 13G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act ”). 1 See Reporting Threshold for Ins titutional Investment Managers , 85 Fed. Reg. 46016 (Jul. 31, 2020), available at (https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf (the “ Proposing Release ”). 2 The Proposal would amend Rule 13f -1 and Form 13F to raise the reporting thresh old for Form 13F from $100 million to $3.5 billion. In the Pr oposing Relea se, the SEC stated that it determined the adjustment based on the gro wth of the U.S. equities market that occurred between the adoption of section 13(f) in 1975 and December 2018, and that it is designed to reflect proportionally the s ame market value of U.S. equities that $100 mi llion represented in 1975 . We agree with t he concerns expressed by Commissioner Allison Herr en Lee , who dissented on the Proposal. In her statement, Commissioner Lee noted that the Proposal “would eliminate access to information about discretion ary acco unts managed by more tha n 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets ” and that the “[t]he costs of losing transparency are glossed over in brief narrative form and largely discounted ” in the Proposing Release . See Statement on the Proposal to Substan tially Reduce 13F Reporting . July 10, 2020. If the Proposal is adopted as proposed , it is estimated that 90% of the institutional investment managers currently subject to Form 13F reporting would no longer be required to report. Based on our review of recen t Form 1 3F filings, many of the leading closed -end fund activist firms would fall significantly below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold and would no longer be required to file Form 13Fs. We have been participating in the eff ort of the Investment Company Institute (the “ICI”) to develop comments on the Proposal and support the recommendation of the ICI in its comment letter not to increase the threshold. We agree with the ICI ’s position that Form 13F serves as a useful source of market data that is widely utilized by market partic ipants, members of the public, and the SEC , including with respect to activist accumulations of positions in closed -end fund s, and that the SEC should encourage and support the transparency and accessibility of this data, rath er than limiting it. We agree with the ICI’s observation in its comment letter that the loss of transparency regard ing the iden tity of investors currently provided by Form 1 3F fil ings would not be in the best interest of closed - end funds, their long -term inve stors, or the public generally. If, however, the SEC believes some increase in the threshold is necessary, we support one of two alternatives depending on the size of the increase. If the SEC supports the ICI fallback position that any increase in the th reshold should be based on inflation, as measu red by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) , such an increase would be acceptable . If the SEC elects to maintain its pos ition that a material increase in the reporting thre shold is necessary , we believe that the Proposal shou ld includ e a carveout provisio n mandating a continu ing reporting o bligation for institutional inves tment managers that have instituted a proxy contest or filed a Form 13D within a prescribed look -back period of at least 5 years regardless of whe ther the inves tment manager ’s holdings of reportable equity securities is below the revised reporting thresh old. Closed-End Fund Activists Shareh older s have chosen to invest in a closed -end fund in part due to the structural advantages that they offer, including the ability to use leverage through preferred shares , 3 maint ain smaller cash positions and hold mo re ill iquid securities. In addition, m any shareholde rs have invested in closed -end fund s at a discount in order to seek higher returns over time relative to a com parable investment in an open -end fund or other vehicle at net asset value. The SEC acknowledged in its proposing release for the 2018 fund of funds proposal that closed -end fund s have h istorically been the target of proxy contests. See Fund of Funds Arrangements (Release Nos. 33 -10590 , Decembe r 19, 2018 at p. 37 and footnote 95 stating that “Since the mid -1990s, closed -end funds that have traded at a discount t o NA V have been the target of proxy contests initiate d by large investors in th ose funds, including other funds. See, e.g ., Tom Lauricella, Proxy Fight at Closed -End Fund Opens Can of Worms for Industry, The Wall Street Journal (Aug. 9, 2002). ”) Closed -end fund activists typically see k a “liquidity event ” at or ne ar net asset value, including a conversion of the closed -end fund to an open -end fund , liquid ation of the closed -end fund , or a substantial tender offer. The closed -end fund activist may use var ious tactics to achieve this objective, including shareholder proposa ls mandating that the closed - end fund conduct a substantial tend er offer at or near NAV, the nomination of director candid ates, liquidation of the closed -end fu nd or termination of the management contract with the closed -end fund ’s existing investment adviser. The activist seeks short -term arbitrage profits from the diffe rence between the discount price of the closed -end fund ’s shares and the price paid in connection with the liquidity e vent. In addition to the cost and burden imposed on closed -end fund s by any related proxy contest, a substantial tender off er resulting from an act ivist sharehol der proposal woul d result in a decrease in the closed -end fund’s siz e and increa se its expense ratio . In order to raise the proceeds to fund the tender offer , the closed -end fu nd may have to sell portfolio securities at sub -optimal pric es. In the case of a convers ion of a closed -end fund to an open -end fund or a liquidation , inves tors would lose the benefit s of an investment in a closed -end fund struc ture. Finally, any narrowin g of the discount in the closed -end fund ’s share price that results from the li quidity event may only be temporary . According to the I CI, the number of closed -end fund s available to investor s has declined steadily since 2011. From 2012 through 2017, more closed-end fund s were liquidated, and others converted into open -end mutual funds or exchange -traded funds, than new closed - end funds were launched. See ICI Research Perspective -The Closed End Fund Marke t-2019 (April 2019). Although the c ause of the decline in the number of closed -end fund s is likely due to multiple factors, the prevalence of closed -end fund activists and the p ursuit of strategies , including open -ending closed -end fund s and liquid ations, has li kely been a contributing facto r to the de cline, reducing the availab ility for retail inv estors of a product structure with unique advantages. Reporting Threshold For the reasons outline d in this letter , we do not support an increase in the Form 1 3F reporting threshold. If, however, the SEC believe s some increase in the threshold is necessary, we support one of tw o alternatives depending on the size of the increase. If the SEC supports the ICI ’s fallback recommendation that any increase in the threshold would be based on inflation, as measured by t he C onsumer Price Index (CPI) , such an increase would be acceptable. If the SEC elects to maintain its pos ition that a material increase in the 4 reporting thre shold is necessary , we believe t hat any material increase in the reportin g threshold should inclu de a carveout provision that mandate s a continu ing reporting obligation for institu tional inves tment managers that have instituted a prox y contest or filed a Form 13D within a 5-year look-back period regardless of whether the inves tment manager ’s holdings of reportable equity securities is below the revised reporting thresh old. This carveout provision would ensure continued transparency regarding a ccumulations of posit ions in closed -end fund s that are below the 5% reporting threshold on Schedule 13D or 13G.2 This carveout would not block initiative s by closed -end fund activists but s imply provide the closed -end fund and its board of t rustees and sponsor with continued transparency regarding accumul ations of positions by activists in the closed -end fun d that are below the Sc hedule 13D or Schedule 13G reporting thresholds. This transparency would facilitate th e ability of the closed -end fund and its board of tr ustees to evaluate changes in the closed -end fund shareholder base and consider potential action s to respond to the closed -end fund activist posit ion that are in the best interest of the closed -end fund ’s long - term shareho lders, including to consider changes to the fund ’s governing documents or other measures to protect the closed -end fund against ac tivist invest ors or to aid the board in assessing the likelihood that a proposal will be successful . Finally, the transparen cy provided by Schedule 13F reporting co uld facilitate timely communica tion with the closed -end fund activist to discuss potential c oncerns r elating to the closed -end fund ’s discount or performance. A continued reporting obligation for firms that have ins tituted a proxy contest is appropriate given that the conduct of a proxy contest is a ha llmark of activism. The proposed carveout mandating a continued reporting obligation for Schedule 13D filers as opposed to S chedule 13G filers would address closed -end fund activists who have accumula ted sh are positions in an issuer in order to change or in fluence co ntrol of the closed -end fund . Under S ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act , any perso n who indirectly or directly becomes the beneficial owner of more than 5% of an issuer’s equity securities registered under Sec tion 12 of the Exchange Act must file wi th th e SEC a Schedule 13D within 10 days after the acquisition . However, there are exempt ions that permit a pe rson may be able to file the more abbreviated Schedule 13G in lieu of filing Schedule 13D. One such exempt ion applies to an “institutional investo r”, which requir es that the person has ac quire d the securities in the ordinary course o f business and not with the purpose or effe ct of changing or influencing the control of the issuer . We be lieve that such a carveout would preserve vital transparency that exists today with respec t to accumulati ons o f position s in closed -end fund s by activists . 2 We ackno wledge that certain CEF activists operate through funds regist ered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are consequent ly subject to portfolio holdings reporting obligations other than pursuant to Section 13 of the Ex change Act. However, prominent CEF activists accumulate posi tions in CEFs throu gh vehicles and accounts other than registered 1940 Act fun ds. 5 Sincerely, Robert L.

(NYSE: FBC), a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Troy, MI, we appr eciate the opportunity to com ment on the SEC’s proposed amendments to the reporting thr eshold for 13F reports by instit utional investment managers (the “Proposal”). We believe that is c rucial to preserve the ability for issuers and investors to maintain access to the many bene fits that 13F reporting provide s and, in principle, support the intent to update and modernize th e requirements. However, we be lieve the proposal is narrowly focused and one-sided, at the expe nse of small and mid-cap issu ers in particular, and limits transparency and the ability to connect with investors. As a re sult, we are writing to express our strong opposition to the Proposal. We believe the Proposal, which would eliminate approximately 89 percent of 13F filings, would result in a significant loss of m arket transparency to our comp any and other publicly traded companies in the United States . If enacted, it would impair our ability to identify and engage with existing shareholders, impede our ability to attract new l ong-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist investors. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership infor mation available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. W hile 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. The Proposal would cause us and ot her publicly traded companies to need to hire stock surveillance firms who woul d undoubtedly have to find other, hi gher cost mechanisms to identify investors since they would not be able to obtain sufficient dat a from 13F reporting. We do not believe that the Commi ssion has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company, and the many other small and mid-c ap companies, and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout th e year. As a company with a $1.6 2 billion market capitaliz ation, we are particularly concerned ab out how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our a bility to identify our most acti ve shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimat e that the proposed increase i n the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 26 of our current top 10 0 investors to evade disclo sure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disc lose shares held, 60 percent of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably e ach quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshol d that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allo cate the limited time of our s enior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We attempt to give priority to not only our largest i nvestors and fund managers bu t also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interes ted in increasing their holdin gs in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F thr eshold, we would not have visib ility into this important group which would impose a severe limitation on our ability to engage our shareholders. Negative Impact on Liquidity of Shares The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term active institutional investors. This is particularly important for our company as our largest shareholder—formerly a majority shareholder—has executed multip le secondary offerings the past 24 months. Like many other issuers, we use the 13F filing s to identify potential shareholders (such as those w ho have invested in similar compan ies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach effo rts to prospective investors. This analysis has been critical for our company in identifying those ta rgets that are best position ed to backfill the position our largest shareholder used to hol d. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying (an d selling) our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to target and compe te for investors. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact proceeding with this rulemakin g will have on companies with large shareholders that are actively divesting positions. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to si gnificantly reduce 13F disclosur es also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and ot her public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid t he market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group , 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo. com/news/sec-proposed- rule-change-step-193708183.html . 3 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for g reater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even great er during these uncertain times , when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investor s who would be exempt from repor ting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparenc y for their benefit and not that of our company’s long-term shareholders. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 bill ion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure thr eshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Withdraw proposal and pursue other 13F reforms While we agree that SEC should mod ernize its ownership disclosu re rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long- term investors, and detect poten tial activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 3 5-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with t he incremental approach the S EC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rul es, such as the Commission’s in flation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,3 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large acce lerated filer status,4 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.5 Inflation during the time period of 1975 to 2020 would be less than a 5-fold increase. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director Willi am Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three-part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital format ion, and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — provi ding the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furtheri ng each aspect of our mission. . ..

While we support the Proposal’s overarching goal of moderniz ing the 13F reporting regime , we join many other s in expressing our concern that the Proposal would do a great disservice to our U.S. capital markets by decreasing the amount of valuable information available to investors. Rather than further restricting 13F reporting requirements, we believe these obligations should be extended to apply to all publicly traded equites – including those traded on OTC markets . Share ownership d isclosure by institutional investment managers and other powerful market participants is an essential component of fair and efficient markets , as it allows public companies and their investors to understand who holds their securities .

Comments to File No. S7- 08-20 Page 2 of 3 activities of institutional investment managers, in order to improve the body of factual data available and to facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence.3 Loosening the disclosure requirements for institutional investors runs contrary to the Commission’s stated goals of tr ansparency in the name of investor protection and market efficiency . The Commission should not only maintain or lower the monetary threshold for 13F reporting, but should also revise the definition of “13(f) securities” to incl ude OTC -traded stocks. Currently, Rule 13f -1(c) defines “sec tion 13(f) securities” (those that trigger Form 13F reports) as including all equity securities traded on an exchange or “ quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities assoc iation ”, which is a reference to the OTC Bulletin Board (or “OTCBB”) operated by FINRA. Over the past ten years, trading activity in OTC equity securities has moved entirely from OTCBB to our markets . As of September 2020, there was not a single security quoted on the OTCBB. In fact, o n September 24, 2020, FINRA filed a proposed rule change seeking to cease operat ion of the OTCBB.4 Therefore, due simply to an outdated reference, the rule unintentionally excludes over 11,000 securities traded on our OTC Link ATS from 13F reporting requirements – including many of the world’s largest multinational companies such as Adidas, Heineken and Roche that choose to have their ADRs trade on these markets rather than an exchange. The Proposal ’s effect of limiting disclosure obligations is also inconsistent with the Commiss ion’s other efforts to increase transparency in our public markets. For example , the Commission recent ly overhaul ed Exchange Act Rule 15c2- 11 to require current public disclosure from all OTC -traded companies in order for brokers to publish quotations in these securities . As noted by Chairman Jay Clayton in an interview concerning the Rule 15c2 -11 amendments , “[t]he bedrock of our federal securities laws is transparency” .5 We are concerned the Proposal would limit, rather than encourage, disclosure and ultimately exacerbate the existing informational asymmetries between large, powerful institutional investors and smaller firms and retail investors . In 2013, we submitted comments on a 13F rulemaking petition, requesting that the Commission expand the scope of 13F reporting to include OTC equity securities traded on the OTCQX, 3 Exchange Act Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5, 1979), 44 FR 3033, at 3033- 3034 (the “1979 Adopting Release”). 4 SR-FINRA -2020- 031, available at: https://www.finra.org/sites/d efault/files/2020- 09/SR -FINRA -2020- 031.pdf 5 Alexander Osipovich , SEC Bolsters Safeguards Against Penny -Stock Fraud, WSJ (Sept. 16, 2020), available at: https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec -bolsters -safeguards -against -penny -stock- fraud- 11600294607 .

As an investor relations professional, I rely on Form 13F filings as critical data in investor communication and to direct shareholder engagement. This rulemaking would exempt 4,500 (89 percent of current 13F filers) from disclosure, including many hedge funds and active money managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. 13F data is critical to IR teams when deciding how to allo cate scarce C -suite time among buy -side investment managers who request a call (or a meeting) with the CEO or CFO. This proposed rule would significantly inhibit issuer -investor engagement, especially by small and mid -cap companies that have a greater per centage of investors who would evade disclosure. The proposal is a puzzling step backward from a Commission that champions disclosure and investor protections. It is troubling that t he SEC did not hold a public meeting or a roundtable or otherwise seek the views of issuers before proposing this rule. Every day I see in the market an urgent need for effective s hare holder engagement . This proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency . I respectfully urge the Commission to reconsider and withdraw this proposal and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of 13F disclosure to improve transparency.

There are absolutely no reasons to make the change, but many reasons to keep the current rules. The SEC and other advocates for investor rights continually talk about the need for increased transparency and accountability for the asset management industry, but this policy change would significantly DECREASE transparency and accountability. I know from personal experience that the reporting requirements are not onerous from a time or cost perspective. The 45 day window for filing ensures that trading information is already stale by the time it is released to the public. It would be a contravention of the SEC's own mission, and its responsibility to tax payers and investors to move forward with this change. Thank you for your consideration."

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules is sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on July 10, 2020, titled Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 (the “Proposing Release”). Business Roundtable understands the Co mmission’s desire to update the thresholds that require institutional investment managers to report their holdings on Form 13F. For the reasons identified below, however, Business Roundtable opposes the Commission’s proposed amendments to increase the For m 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion (the “Proposal”) and urges the Commission to table this effort until, and as discussed below, there is an alternative source of information regarding the identities of shareholders of public compa nies to replace that which is currently available as a result of the existing Form 13F reporting requirements. Alternatively, we urge the Commission to take a more measured approach in changing the threshold. THE IMPORTANCE OF FORM 13F INFORMATION FO R MARKET TRANSPARENCY AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The Proposal would drastically reduce information available to the public about the identity of the institutional holders of a public company’s shares. This significant reduction in market transparency wou ld hamper companies’ efforts to engage with their shareholders and runs counter to the Commission’s and Chair Clayton's efforts otherwise to increase transparency in the markets. In order to better understand shareholder needs and what behaviors sharehold ers prioritize, companies need to know who their shareholders are. September 29, 2020 Page 2 A successful shareholder engagement program requires companies to be able to identify their shareholders and proactively engage with them through direct outreach. Yet few sources of this information currently exist. As the Commission itself noted in the Proposing Release, “[t]he data [included in Form 13F] can also assist … corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock.” In a shareholding system primarily comprised of “Objecting Bene ficial Owners” (“OBOs”), there is already limited transparency today. Shareholders are not required to identify themselves as owners of a company’s shares unless they cross the 5% beneficial owner reporting threshold applicable under Sections 13(d) and 13 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). This is a very high hurdle and not a practical source of information for shareholder engagement. Our typical member company only has a small handful of shareholders that beneficially own more than 5% of the company’s outstanding stock. Consequently, our member companies and/or the third -party advisors on whom they rely for shareholder information utilize Form 13F filings to identify, and facilitate meaningful engagement with, a significant number of their shareholders. Such engagement may be particularly important for a company in sharing its rationale and approach to issues of core importance to shareholders. We believe that amending the Form 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would signific antly impair shareholder engagement by triggering a substantial loss of market transparency. This loss of transparency would put small and medium sized institutional holders at a disadvantage from a company -engagement perspective. Form 13F filings serve as the single source of information regarding which “street name” investors are buying and selling stock each quarter, without which our members would not be able to identify a significant number of their shareholders, particularly smaller to medium sized institutional holders. For example, if companies are able to identify the positions of large asset managers and certain hedge funds, but not the positions of small to medium sized institutional holders, companies will, of necessity, dedicate a disproporti onate amount of time to a limited subset of their shareholders. This subset would not include a potentially important universe of institutional holders for targeted engagement – firms with a more focused portfolio that, while holding only a relatively sma ll number of investments may have sizeable positions in particular companies that would fall below the threshold given their total portfolio size. In this instance, the smaller institutional holder with higher relative exposure to a company may be preclud ed from gaining the same level of access to management that larger assets under management shareholders would have purely based on their disclosures – or lack thereof. We urge the Commission to fully consider the potential impacts of these consequences on investor relations efforts and corresponding shareholder engagement. Finally, we believe the loss of Form 13F data would also impede our members’ ability to attract new capital from long -term institutional investors. Analyzing quarterly trends such as t he buying and selling of securities as well as broader investment shifts across industries are important in identifying potential pools of capital that would be interested in investing in our members’ securities. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of visibility into those trends across the broader investment universe would hinder the ability of our member companies to compete for and raise growth capital. Further, shareholders that may be considering an September 29, 2020 Page 3 investment in a public company would be deprived of a source of data that may be relevant to their investment decision. THE IMPORTANCE OF FORM 13F INFORMATION FOR MONITORING SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM In addition to its importance to market transparency and shareholder engagement, companies also use Form 13F data to monitor and assess activist investors in advance of such investors triggering the disclosure requirements under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. Under the Proposal, the loss of this data could impair a company’s ability to detect a potential activist, delay its response and expose the company and its shareholders to heightened risk. Especially in times of high market volatility , companies need greater, not less, transparency in addressing potential activist investors that could take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies, to the potential detriment of long -term investors. Under th e proposed $3.5 billion threshold, companies would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus enabling activists to use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of long -term shareholders. REQUEST TO TABLE PROPOSED CHANGES AND DEVELOP REFORM THAT ADDRESSES CONCERNS The Commission described the problems faced by public companies and others in identifying company shareholders in its 2010 Concept Release on the U.S. Proxy Sy stem (“Proxy Plumbing Concept Release”).1 In the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release, the Commission asked wide - ranging questions about how to approach these problems and received meaningful input through the comment process. For various reasons, the Commiss ion has not yet had an opportunity to act on many of the important questions raised in the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release, including developing a solution to the shareholder identification problem. Business Roundtable appreciates the Commission’s goals in proposing to update and modernize the Section 13(f) reporting system and to save costs for smaller advisers through that effort. But we believe the costs associated with the loss in transparency and the related constraints on access to capital in an i ncreasingly competitive market would be detrimental to the public capital markets and its investors, particularly without an alternative source of the important information provided through Form 13F. Against this backdrop and for the reasons discussed above, Business Roundtable and its member companies urge the Commission to table the Proposal and move forward with this modernization effort in the future when the needs of all stakeholders in this important area can be addressed concurrently – for examp le through Commission action to address the current 1 Release Nos. 34 -62495; IA -3052; IC -29340; File No. S7 -14-10 (July 14, 2010). September 29, 2020 Page 4 inability of public companies to identify their shareholders, as discussed in the Proxy Plumbing Concept Release. If the Commission determines that it will move forward with the Proposal without a solu tion to the shareholder identification problem, Business Roundtable believes that the Commission should take a more measured approach to the change in threshold. Rather than moving from a $100 million threshold to $3.5 billion – a dramatic increase of 35 -fold – any change should be incremental to allow market participants and the Commission to assess the impact of this loss of transparency. A more measured approach would also be consistent with actions taken by the Commission when modifying thresholds in previous rule amendments, such as the Commission’s adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,2 the inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth com panies3 and the adjustments to the thresholds for smaller reporting companies.4 CONCLUSION Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the Proposal. We believe regulatory reform efforts around reporting of public company shar eholders are of critical importance, and we look forward to sharing our views with the Commission as you move forward on these initiatives in the future. Thank you for considering our comments and recommendations. We would be happy to discuss these comments or any other matters you believe would be helpful.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549- 1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (SEC Rel. No. 34-89290; File No. S7- 08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: The Investment Adviser Association ( IAA) 1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Commission’s propos al to raise the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers, eliminate the omission threshold for individual securities, r equir e managers to provide additional identifying information, modernize the structure of data reporting , and a mend the instructions on Form 13F for confidential treatment requests.2 We commend the Commission for its efforts to modernize regulatory requirements that have not be en updated in decades. We support raising the $100 million threshold for Form 13F reporting but recommend a substantially more modest increase that takes into account how the users and uses of Form 13F reports have evolved since the reporting threshold was originally adopted. We make the following recommendations that we believe will be tter balance the goals of transparency and limiting regulatory burdens, especially on smaller advisers : A. The Commission should raise the reporting threshold more mode rately than proposed – from $100 million to $500 million – and should permit voluntary filings under the threshold. 1 The IAA is the largest organization dedicated to advancing the interests of SEC -registered investment advisers. For more than 80 years, the IAA has been advocating for advisers before Congress and U.S. and global regulators, promoting best practices and providing education and resources to empower advisers to effectively serve their clients, the capital markets, and the U.S. economy. The IAA’s member firms manage more than $25 trillion in assets for a wide variety of individual and institutional clients, including pension plans, trusts, mutual funds, private funds, endowments, foundations, and corporations.

Reg. 46016 (proposed July 31 , 2020), https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34- 89290.pdf (Proposal ). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 2 of 8 B. The Commission should not eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F and should consider raising this threshold as part of its review of the reporting threshold every five years . C. The staff should conduct its initial future analysis sooner than five years if it significantly raises the reporting threshold . D. The Commission should not require additional identifying information in Form 13F. It should study on a more holistic basis issues raised by requiring the use of licensed nu mbers in regulations . E. The Commission should not make technical amendments to the well -established rounding conventions or how a security’s value is reported. F. The Commission should make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13F’s requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F . Our comments are discussed below. A. The Commission should raise the reporting threshold more moderately than propose d – from $100 million to $500 million – and should permit voluntary filings under the threshold. We agree with the Commission that the current $100 million threshold for Form 13F reporting is outdated and should be raised. We also agree that the threshold is no longer in line with Congress’s original intent to provide transparency into t he concentration of institutional ownership of equities holdings of larger managers that have the potential to significantly affect the securities markets , while limiting the burdens associated with filing the reports to the largest institutional investment managers . 3 Over the intervening years, however, as more and more institutional invest ment managers have been required to file a Form 13F, the ways in which market particip ants have used the information in the reports have evolved beyond looking to them to f ill in the trading information gaps of the large st managers . Market participants, including some of our members , view the reports as providing important public benefits that would be largely eliminated if the Commission were to raise the reporting threshold in the amount proposed. We believe that the Commission would strike a better balance between maintaining fair, open, and orderly markets and reducing burdens on smaller institutional investment managers by raising the threshold to $500 million, rather than the $3.5 billion proposed. 3 According to the Proposal: “The 1975 Amendments Senate Report reasoned that, by setting the threshold at $100 million, the burdens associated with filing Form 13F would be limited to ‘ the largest institutional investment managers ’ and, therefore, the new filing requirements could be ‘ implemented rapidly with the least amount of unnecessary costs and burdens on the potential respondents. ’” Proposal at 9 . Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 3 of 8 Today, a very large number of SEC -registered investment advisers must file a Form 1 3F,4 and we believe that most IAA members now file Form 13F reports. The compliance burden of filing these reports is more acute for our smaller members. Our l arger members tend to contract with third -party vendors to assist with Form 13F reporting. For these advisers, technology and other resources ha ve lessened the burdens of Form 13F compared to other regulatory and compliance burdens that they face. O ur smaller members , by contrast, tend to handle the reporting in-house. We understand that the software that many smaller advisers use can be difficult to work with and that m anual effort s are often needed to comb through the data, read and detect errors in HTML files, and reconcile CUSIP numbers that systems do not recognize because they begin with a zero.5 Raising the threshold would provide these smaller advisers with welcome relief . On the other hand, we understand from our members that firms across all sizes greatly value t he data they obtain from Form 13F reports and, even for many smaller advisers, the ability to access that data outweighs their own filing burdens. These firms prioritize preserving as much transparency as possible over raising the Form 13F reporting threshold. For other small advi sers, however, the burdens clearly outweigh the benefits. The benefits provided by Form 13F data have evolved over time and are many . Today, Form 13F information is extremely valuable to a wide array of investment advisers and others . Traditional asset managers, for example, find the information useful in managing actively managed strategies , particularly in the small and mid -cap space. S ponsors to closed- end funds rely on Form 13F reports to monitor activist shareholder activity (before reporting persons reach the beneficial ownership or investment levels that trigger Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G, or Form N-PORT filings) . Form 13F gives more information about the diversity of shareholder ownership than data from these other sources. Exchange- traded funds utilize Form 13F data to help satisfy their regulatory obligations, understand their shareholder base, determine how concentrated ownership is in their shares, and provide educational materials and other services to their shareholders . Some s maller managers also are aided by the visibility into the markets that reporting confers. In addition, when they file Form 13F reports they may benefit from b eing recognized as an investor , which can facilitate research and meetings with current an d prospective issuers , thereby increasing the potential for expanding the firm or asset base. Institutional investors that allocate their capital to investment managers also rely on Form 13F reports as an important part of their due diligence i n tracking those managers . The reports provide more extensive and granular data on specific holdings than these investors might 4 As of December 31, 2018, 5,089 institutional investment managers filed Form 13F holdings reports (Form 13F - HR) and an additional 1,570 managers filed form 13F -NT notice reports. Proposal at 16 and n. 40. We do not have data on how many of these filers are SEC -registered investment advisers but we believe that the number is substantial. 5 The Commission may want to consider facilitating the filing of Form 13F through a system, similar to the Investment Adviser Registration Depository , that does not require the use of HTML files, special software, or the assistance of third -party vendors. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 4 of 8 otherwise receive and help them hold managers accountable as to their actual portfolio holdings. The holdings -level details in these report s provide a better understanding of the portfolio than the more high level information that is included in quarterly letters , for example . Form 13F reports thus help institutional investors identify potential mismatches between a stated strategy and actual investments; concentration levels and potential crowded trades ; liquidity; long -term purchase and sale decisions; shifts in a manager’s portfolio as its AUM expands or contracts; and performance by sectors. Institutional investors often seek out pools managed by small- and mid- sized managers in which to invest. If the filing threshold were raised significantly, these institutional investors would lose an important risk management tool that helps them keep a close watch on the smaller managers that they retain. 6 We strongly believe in transparent markets . We agree that t ransparency contributes to safer and fairer markets and is an important goal. And, as these examples demonstrate, Form 13F reports greatly enhance the transparency and safety of the system as a whole. However, transparency needs to be balanced against other considerations, including whether the compliance burdens on small managers are justified . Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission raise the reporting threshold sufficiently to provide relief to the smallest managers but not so high that managers, investors, and the markets lose the myriad benefits of the data. The Commission asks whether the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion is appropriate and, if another threshold would be more appropriate, what the threshold should be and why .7 While we understand the Commission’s rationale for proposing $3.5 billion as the new threshold and we recognize that the rationale for a lower threshold is a departure fro m Congress’s original intent, we believe that, given the evolution in how Form 13F reports are used, a lower threshold than that proposed is necessary and appropriate in the public interest , for the protection of investors , and to maintain fair and orderly markets. 8 We recommend, instead, that the Commission revise the threshold to $500 million.9 We believe that an updated threshold of $500 6 As demonstrated by these examples, Form 13F data provide many valuable benefits even with the current 45 -day delay period. While we appreciate that the Commission is proposing changes to the scope of managers required to file reports on Form 13F before considering other potential amendments to the Form (Proposal at 12, n. 28) , we note that we strongly oppose shortening the 45- day delay in Form 13F’s reporting deadline. This lag time effectively avoids most of our members’ serious concerns about front running or copying of their investment strategies and we are concerned that s hortening the time would revive those concerns. 7 Proposal at 26 ( Question 1 ). 8 Section 13(f)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that the Commission, in exercising its authority under section 13(f), “determine (and so state) that its action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors or to maintain fair and orderly markets.” 9 Given that the IAA represent s a very broad spectrum of investment advisers, we note that some of our members support the C ommission ’s proposed threshold of $3.5 billion, while some of our members oppose any increase in the $100 million reporting threshold. Raising the threshold from $100 million to $500 million would approximate the 3.54 percent average annual rate of inflation since 1975. See https://www.inflationtool.com/us -dollar/1975- to-present -value . This increase, while Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 5 of 8 million would preserve many of the benefits of greater transparency into the markets while relieving smaller managers of the compliance burdens related to filing , and that this strikes an appropriate balance.10 We also recommend that, t o accommodate those smaller managers that wish to continue filing Form 13F reports , the Commission permit voluntary filing for institutional investment managers that exercise investment discretion between $100 million and $500 million in Section 13(f) securities . Permitting voluntary filing would allow smaller managers to continue to be recognized as investors, should they so elect, and to receive the benefits they associate with that recognition. B. The Commission should not eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F and should consider raising this threshold as part of its review of the reporting threshold every five years . Form 13F allows, but does not require, a manager to omit holdings below a certain share limit and value limit, i.e., holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amount of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggrega te fair market value ( the “omission threshold ”). The Commission is proposing to eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F on the basis that , if the reporting threshold is substantially increased, the omission threshold would no longer be necessary or a ppropriate and th e incremental increase in cost of including securities holdings information below an omission threshold i s likely immaterial. We believe, however, that the Commission is undervaluing the importance of the omission threshold to managers of all sizes. We understand from our members that the omission threshold would continue to provide important relief regardless of the reporting threshold amount . Even large firms rely on this de minimis standard, a s it can be burdensome to identify which of hundreds of small positions are eligible for reporting on Form 13F , regardless of the reporting threshold. In addition, in our view, any marginal benefit to the Commission or the public from disclosure of stock holding s whose absolute values are not of a material size is clearly outweighed by the burdens on managers to identify and report these small positions. We thus request that the Commission maintain an omission threshold for all managers. We further recommend that the Commission consider updating the omission threshold every five years as part of its r eview of the reporting threshold. This would help to ease the reporting burdens of firms of all sizes, account for the effects of inflation, and assist firms whose clients transfer small legacy positions to a new adviser . modest, would strike a compromise by providing relief to over 60 percent of advisers . See Table 1 of the Proposal at 16-17, which shows that 62.6 percent of filers would be below a threshold of $500 million or more. 10 If the Commission nonetheless decides to substantially increase the reporting threshold, and bases the adjustment on market growth, we suggest that the Commission use a five-year average stock market rate of growth to minimize the effects of market fluctuations . Proposal at 26 (Question 4). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 6 of 8 C. The staff should conduct its initial future analysis sooner than fiv e years if it significantly raises the reporting threshold. We fully support the proposal that the staff conduct reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold every five years and, if appropriate, recommend an adjustment to the Commission. However, if the Co mmission raises the reporting threshold significantly higher than a moderate increase such as the one that we recommend, we suggest that the staff consider conducting the first of these reviews sooner than five years after raising the threshold in order to evaluate the impact on the market and market participants of a substantial increase in the threshold . Subsequently, we support conducting these reviews every five years. D. The Commission should not require additional identifying information in Form 13F. It should study on a more holistic basis issues raised by requiring the use of licensed numbers in regulations . We believe that Form 13F File Number s have worked well and do not see the need for filers to provide additional identifying information such as CRD numbers and SEC filing numbers. In addition, CUSIP number s are recognized as a basic and simple way to identify a security. S witching to a n alternat ive identifier would be burdensome and could have the potential for error and we thus recommend that the Commission not replace CUSIP numbers with another identifier at this time. As a general matter, however , we believe that build ing requirements into regulations that subject registrants to ongoing related licensing fees and other obligations raises important policy issues. A s we have previously stated to the Commission, 11 S&P holds the license to CUSIP numbers and has been impos ing increasingly burdensome fees on investment advisers, investors, and others for the acquisition, retention, and use of CUSIP identifiers.12 We understand that S&P has be en contacting investment advisers and others seeking to collect significant licensing fees for the use of CUSIP identifiers regardless of the source or use of such numbers. S&P evidentl y takes the position that even using CUSIP identifiers in a firm’s internal database serves as a basis for a request for licensing fees. Licensing fees appear to range from approximately $10,000 per year for an institutional user to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for unlimited global 11 See Letter from The Bond Dealers of America, the IAA, and the Government Finance Officers Associ ation of the United States and Canada (Sept. 9, 2014), available at https://higherlogicdownload.s 3.amazonaws.com/INVESTMENTADVISER/aa03843e- 7981- 46b2- aa49 - c572f2ddb7e8/UploadedImages/publications/140909cmnt.pdf (expressing deep concerns regarding the operation of the CUSIP system, Commission rules that require the use of CUSIP numbers, and the collect ion of fees by Standard & Poor ’s (S&P ) for usage of CUSIP’s standard security identifiers); see also Letter from The Bond Dealers of America, the IAA, and the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (Nov. 10, 2010), available at https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/INVESTMENTADVISER/aa03843e -7981- 46b2- aa49 -c572f2ddb7e8/UploadedImages/publications/101110cmnt.pdf . 12 CUSIP identifiers are assigned to new securities issue s by the CUSIP Service Bureau, which is operated by S&P . S&P is the CUSIP Service Bureau contract administrator for the American Bankers Association, the owner of the CUSIP identifiers. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 7 of 8 licenses. We therefore urge the Commission to initiate a holistic review of S&P’s licensing practices relating to CUSIP identifiers and consider w hether requiring the use of licensed identification numbers in regulatory filings of all types ( including but not limited to Form 13F) poses potential liability , subjects users to the payment of use fees, or is otherwise problematic. E. The Commission should not make technical amendments to the well -established rounding conventions or how a security’s value is reported . Because of the operational challenges and costs that implementation would entail, w e request that the Commission not amend Form 13F to requir e all dollar values listed on Form 13F to be rounded to the nearest dollar . For the same reason, we also request that the Commission not remove the requirement that filers omit the “000” when reporting dollar values on Form 13F . We are not aware of data inaccuracies resulting from current reporting requirement s and believe, therefore, that the implementation costs would outweigh any marginal benefit from these changes . 13 F. The C ommission should make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13F’s requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F. We recommend that the Commission make a technical amendment to eliminate Form 13F’s requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit that the signature of the person signing a report on Form 13F may be retained electronic ally. This would mean that fi lers would no longer be required to retain a manually signed copy of Form 13F. Over 20 years ago, the E - Sign Act 14 authorized the creation of electronic contracts, as well as the use of electronic records relating to such agreements. The E -Sign Act provided uniform national standards for the use of electronic signatures, which have grown in use and importance over the past few years . Having the option to retain an electronic signature would substantially reduce th e burdens of obtaining manual signatures under certain circumstances , such as the current COVID -19 pandemic.15 Our members appreciate the staff ’s recognition of the challenges raised by the manual signature requirement and its statement providing relief regarding the authentication document retention requirements to those affected by COVID -19. 16 However, filers are still required to 13 The Commission could consider other amendments to improv e the current reporting regime , such as e xcluding nondiscretionary holdings. 14 See Electronic Signature s in National and Global Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) , Public Law No. 106-229 (June 30, 2000). 15 For example, the Internal Revenue Service recently announced that it wi ll temporarily permit digital signatures on more forms through the end of 2020 to limit in- person contact between employees and taxpayers or their representatives. 16 See Staff Statement Regarding Rule 302(b) of Regulation S -T in Light of COVID -19 Concerns (June 25 , 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/rule -302b- regulation -s-t-covid -19-update . Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 8 of 8 retain a manually signed signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging, or otherwise adopting their signature ; indicate the date and time when the signature was executed ; hold it until offices re -open ; and establish and maintain policies a nd procedures governing this process. This has proven problematic for filers and we believe more expansive, permanent relief is warranted . First, some individuals are not able to print documents when working remotely . Second, due to the extended time many in the industry have been working remotely, there is a risk that manually signed documents may become lost, misplaced, or damaged , or that confidentiality may be compromised . Electronic signatures have the advantages of a time stamp and automa ted document retention. Accordingly, as part of the Commission’ s initiative to modernize Form 13F, we urge the Commission to eliminate Form 13F’s requirement for a manual signature and expressly permit the retention of electronic signatures and records for Form 13F. * * * We appreciate the Commission’s consideration of our comments on the proposed amendments to Form 13F and would be happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful.

The SEC ’s proposal, under which 89 percent of current filers would no longer submit Form 13F, would deny publicly traded companies such as ResMed vital insight into their ownership and that of other publicly traded companies in the United States . Form 13F data is our only source of data that shows “ street name” investors buying or selling our shares each quarter —we cannot obtain this information elsewhere . As a large -cap company valued at approximately $25 billion, we are concerned the proposed new Form 13F filing threshold would impair our abili ty to e ngage with shareholders and manage investor relationships in a way that effectively furthers our business goals , including the development of life -saving healthcare technology . The proposed rule would also impede our ability to target and attract new long -term investors . 1 Securities and Exchange C ommission, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Proposed Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 46,016 (July 31, 2020). ResMed 9001 Spectrum Center Boulevard San Diego CA 92123 USA ResMed.com The information included on the Form 13F enables ResMed to build and maintain relationships with key shareholders as an important element of our business and investor relations strategy . 13F data allows us to identify and p rioritize engagement with investors who are interested in maintaining or increasing their holdings , as well as to target and reach to potential future investors . If the Commission finalizes its proposed reporting threshold of $3.5 billion, we estimate that 52% of our current 13F filers would fall out of scope. Without 13F information regarding who is holding as well as buying and selling our shares , ResMed will be unable to engage effectively with those investors. Our company also uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We use 13F filing information t o help prioritize time with not only our largest investors and fund managers, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are aligned in their long -term interest in our company. If the SEC moves forward with its proposed increase in the 13F thre shold, we would not have visibility into this important group of smaller investors . The information provided by 13F filings cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F filing data as a starting point for their research efforts. Additionally, as a company that seeks to improve patient health outcomes through advancements in medical technology, ResMed must effectively manage relationships with current investors and identify potential new investors to rai se crucial capital. ResMed uses Form 13F data to collect information regarding shareholders that have invested in similar companies and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts. By preventing us from gathering this information for a large porti on of investors , the substantial increase that the Commission proposes to the Form 13F threshold would threaten our ability to effectively access the capital markets and grow our business. Thus, a drastically heightened disclosure threshold could negativel y affect our research and development of groundbreaking medical devices and software. In light of these concerns, we urge the Commission not to finalize its proposed update to the reporting threshold for Form 13F. Instead, the agency should maintain the current threshold of $100 million or pursue a much more modest increase that does not so significantly undermine transparency . Additionally, as opposed to reducing market visibility, we recommend that the Commission consider promoting increased 13F transparency by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutti ng the 45 -day reporting period.

As a provider of data, tools and insights that help decision makers navigate the global markets, S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Amendment issued by the Commission on July 10, 2020 and understands the Commission’s desire to streamline and update polices that have been in place for 45 years. We do, however, have some concerns and would respectfully request the Commission consider the impact of the Proposed Amendment on market transparency, shareholder engagement, and the quality of the data financial markets use every day to make informed decisions. Below, Market Intelligence has identified several issues we would ask you to consider. We agree the Commission should update polices when appropriate in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner, but we are concerned the Proposed Amendment could have unintended consequences for all market participants. IMPACT ON FINANCIAL MARKETS Market Intelligence strives to provide the highest quality data to financial markets for all sectors and participants to use and consider. We believe this transparency is a key element of the world’s most robust and successful credit markets. As currently laid out, the Proposed Amendment would raise the 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, a 35-times proposed increase in the threshold which would result in substantiality less transparency from 90% of current filers. Without an alternative source of data from nearly 90% of investment managers regarding the identities of shareholders of public companies, the ability to provide timely and relevant data to both shareholders and companies will result in less engagement from both sides. From a market transparency angle, raising the 13F threshold could adversely impact both smaller asset managers and retail investors alike. S&P Global Market Intelligence 55 Water Street New York, NY 10041 In addition, the Proposed Amendment estimates raising the threshold to $3.5 billion would effectively eliminate data from more than 4,500 investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion. Market Intelligence regularly interacts with all sectors of the financial markets. We’ve seen many of these managers, whose reporting requirements would be eliminated under the Proposed Amendment, become more active in engaging with issuers on matters relating to long-term strategy, capital, and other important business decisions. Feedback from our clients also indicates that lack of data from these smaller managers and their ownership levels would impede this process. Investment managers also use 13F data from other peer managers to frequently benchmark themselves as part of the capital raising process. The lack of relevant benchmark data for smaller managers would make it more difficult for these managers to raise capital and would unfairly disadvantage them vs larger managers for whom relevant peer benchmarking data would be easily accessible. Based on our interactions with market participants, we expect shareholders, policymakers, and companies to be more engaged with each other more than ever before. Making transparent who owns public company shares only furthers that conversation. Without a mechanism to identify shareholders, meaningful engagement between both parties is likely to diminish and, in some cases, reduces a firm’s capability to access capital markets in a cost effective manner. Market Intelligence urges the Commission to fully consider the potential impacts of these consequences on investor relations as well. While the Proposed Amendment acknowledges the $3.5 billion threshold would retain disclosure of more than 90% of the value of holdings that are currently reported, we’ve interacted and seen many market participants engage with one another who would not fit in this definition, therefore eliminating transparency to important parts of our financial markets. ITEMS TO CONSIDER Based on the above-mentioned concerns about transparency and market engagement, Market Intelligence also suggests the Commission look at a more modest change to the 13F threshold based on the Consumer Price Index. This approach would be consistent with other adjustments government agencies have made, including the Commission’s accelerated filer status or the inflation-based increase for emerging growth companies. We believe a more incremental change would allow market participants to better assess the impact of less transparency. As mentioned above, the Commission acknowledges that a wide variety of individuals use 13F data, including data providers. We respectfully request that the Commission not only consider the impact on small asset managers but expand the impact analysis to accurately measure the loss of this data on other market participants. As a data provider, we are aware of different types of usage for 13F filings from various market participants that rely on our service to provide them with the best in class information to take decisions with conviction. We recommend looking at the following who are also users of this data and consider the impact on them as well: • the general public, whom 13F data helps create an environment of confidence in the markets; • for investors and fund managers to be able to compare their monthly reports with the 13F data; S&P Global Market Intelligence 55 Water Street New York, NY 10041 • for investors and fund managers to better evaluate their existing advisory relationship and/or identify other investment advisers that are more suited to their investment strategies or needs; • for the sell-side to evaluate buy side targets; • to identify all owners of a given company and seek investors engagements; • to evaluate potential investor activism; • to evaluate who to partner with to start a campaign; • to identify opportunities for individual investors; and • to help legal departments to expedite their claims for affected parties. The effects of the proposal on smaller companies should also be considered. Increasing the threshold would have a larger impact on small and mid-cap public companies as they typically have a larger portion of shareholders that fall below the $3.5 billion threshold in assets under management. Small-cap firms would lose transparency on 15% of their shareholders while mid-cap firms would lose transparency on 10%. As data providers and analysts, Market Intelligence has often seen smaller investment managers play an active role with long term strategy and business operations. In some cases, this relationship can have significant effects on the management of smaller companies. CONCLUSION At Market Intelligence, our analysis and information help market participants create successful shareholder engagement programs, but to do so, companies need to be able to identify their shareholders. With few sources of information that currently exist on this subject, 13F data is a vital source of information that helps provide transparency to global markets, particularly for small and medium firms. Market Intelligence appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the Proposed Amendment. We believe regulatory reform efforts around reporting of public company shareholders are of critical importance, and we look forward to sharing our views with the Commission as you move forward on these initiatives in the future. Market Intelligence welcomes the opportunity to continue to be part of the ongoing dialogue on this important issue. Thank you for considering our comments and for your work on this important topic. Sincerely, Martina Cheung President"

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, D .C. 20549 -1090 Attn: File Number S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Secretary Countryman : I write in response to t he Commission’s proposal to update the reporting requirements of Form 13F, specifically in regard to question 25 concerning other potential amendments to the form. As noted in your request for comment , the equities market has changed significantly over the last 45 years, both in size and complexity. For this reason, s tandardization of data for securities is increasingly important for money managers, regulators and outside observers. The R Street Institute i s a nonprofit, nonpartisan, public policy organization dedicated to promoting free markets and limited, effective government. We focus on improving America’s system of governance and providing practical solutions for streamlining and simplifying the way it operates. Our specialty is tackling issues that are complex, but do not necessarily grab major headlines. These are the areas where we think we can have a real impact. We believe permitt ing managers to provide alternative identifie rs to CUSIP would spur innovation in the industry and provide alternatives when CUSIPs are not the best option. For one, CUSIPs do not always convey all information about a financial instrument. On Form 13F, firms report options and exchange -traded derivatives using equity CUSIPs, which contain no information about strike prices. It’s also worth noting that current identifiers are likely to be inadequate with the rise of crypto -assets in the marketplace. Equities do not currently trade on CUSIPs, and only some fixed income assets do, and there is no single identifier that ties various assets together. Ticke rs are also specific to exchange, with CUSIPs limited to settlement in the U.S. market, creat ing complications when stocks are settled on foreign exchanges in diffe rent currencies. R Street Institute • 1212 New York Ave NW #900 • Washington, D .C. 20005 • (202) 525 -5717 Additionally, CUSIPs can change or otherwise take multiple forms for the same entity . While the CUSIP -6 identifies a security’s issuing party, a new base may be created when security issuance passes a certain threshold, resulting in multi ple bases for the same entity. They also may be reused, and identification problems can arise in instances when entities change names. However, as long as regulatory reporting continues to require one identifier at the expense of others , the industry will remain reliant on it despite the potential for more modern identification schema. This lack of standardization is a major problem for securities analysts, as well as those of us who study municipal finance, as there are cost s for third -party analysts even to know the right CUSIP for a given security . Further expenses for l icensing and obtaining identifier s upon initial issuing only add to the burden faced by security issuers. Allowing managers reporting on Form 13F to use the identifie rs best suited for their instruments would have far -reaching benefits beyond strictly this reporting. Market participant s would likely adapt quicker to the increasingly complex trading markets and the benefits that come from open data standards. Whether the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) referenced in the request for comment proves to be the alternative that arises is secondary to allowing the market to determine the best way forward. Although FIGI is currently the only open data id entifier available, this would not necessarily remain the case in a market environment where competition is opened up. Allowing market choice would enable identifiers to evolve and ultimately increase interoperability. We are strong proponents of the use of metadata, and open -source, machine -readable data across all areas of government, and just as important is ensurin g that regulatory requirements do not discourage similar best practices from being used in the private sector. Allowing for alternative iden tifiers on Form 13F would assist in moving the marketplace in this direction and solve the problems that currently exist with security identification.

(TSX, NYSE: NTR) (the “Company”), the world’s largest provider of crop inputs a nd services with a market capitalization of approximately US $23 billion and its shares publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange, I am writing on behalf of the Company to request that the Commission reconsider its propo sed amendment to the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers. The Company is a signatory to the NYSE Group, Inc.’s recently submitted letter requesting the same of the Commission and is submitting this letter to provide the Comm ission with a more detailed perspective of the adverse impacts such amendment would have on the Company. The Company is concerned that raising the Form 13F reporting threshold will harm its ongoing efforts to meaningfully engage with its shareholders (including any possible activist investors), slowing the constructive corporate governance process. Further, t he Company believes the proposed amendment would impede its ability to both communicate with existing shareholders and attract new long -term investors and deprive it of timely information about activists that take positions in its stock. The Company treat s continuous shareholder engagement as a year -round endeavor, extending well beyond the traditional “proxy season.” The Company’s dedicated Investor Relations team seeks to communicate with the widest possible sample of shareholders to collect feedback on the Company’s strategies, performance, and corporate governance and sustainability practices. The Company takes this feedback very seriously, discussing the data at the management and Board level as the Company contemplates proposals to present at its an nual shareholder meetings. Of course, these outreach efforts include communications with the Company’s largest known institutional investors and proxy advisory firms, as well as individual investors who have otherwise publicly disclosed stakes in the Company’s stock. However, in order to effectively engage with its shareholders, the Company relies heavily on the information provided on Forms 13F (especially those filed by midsize managers that would be lost under the Commission’s proposed threshold ch ange) to identify a critical subset of representative investors. The Company does not currently have any Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G filers. If the Commission’s proposal were enacted, the Company estimates it would lose visibility into approximately 60 % of its institutional shareholder base, or 359 of its 623 shareholders that are current 13F filers. This would be a significant blow to the strategic outreach and shareholder engagement that the Company and its predecessor companies have developed over ma ny decades. September 29, 2020 Page 2 nutrien.com 13131 Lake Fraser Drive S.E. • Calgary/Alberta • T2J 7E8 • Canada In addition, losing the insight currently provided by 13F data would impede the Company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Among other tools, the Company uses 13F filings for the Company and similar industry participants to identi fy potential investors and to measure the effectiveness of outreach to prospective investors. Without the insight provided by Form 13F, the Company would not be able to undertake the affirmative outreach to small and midsize investors that is currently imp ortant to its shareholder engagement strategy. Instead, the Company would be forced to engage only with investors that directly reach out. Similar to any other statistical sampling, this reactive approach suffers from voluntary response bias, where only those with extreme positions or opinions are motivated enough to initiate contact. Because shareholder engagement feedback ultimately informs the Company’s management and Board regarding its proxy statement and annual shareholder meeting agenda, the Compa ny is concerned that introducing such bias into its decision -making process will negatively impact corporate governance decisions and public shareholders in general. Furthermore, this reactive position all but guarantees a market -wide increase in very ex pensive proxy contests with activist investors. In addition to standard shareholder engagement, companies use data from Form 13F filings to identify situations where an activist investor may be preparing for a proxy contest. The Company understands many companies are successful in reaching out to activist investors to discuss their concerns ahead of the need to resort to proxy contests. The parties are often able to arrive at mutually acceptable resolutions, but these constructive conversations take time . It is optimal to be able to identify such situations as early as possible rather than being surprised with a Schedule 13D filing or an open letter to management. The Company believes that avoiding the expense and distraction of proxy contests by crafti ng creative, constructive solutions with investors is almost always preferable to the alternative. While the Company supports constructive modifications and updates to the Commission’s rules and regulations, the Company believes that market transparency an d enhancing issuer -investor engagement should be the driving considerations. Therefore, the Company urges the Commission not to adopt the proposed amendment to the Form 13F reporting threshold and instead, refocus its efforts on the modernization of 13F di sclosure requirements to improve transparency.

In that regard, we would support granting permission to provide other identifiers, where they meet certain basic qualities specifically that they conform to generally accepted open data standards, include descriptive information, and both the identifier and descriptive information are publicly accessible without restrictions on access, use or other barriers. This would have a beneficial effect in increasing transparency, interoperability, and accessibility to data by firms, investors, and the general public.

Molineaux, President & CEO, Life Sciences Pennsylvania",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860021-223863.pdf,,"September 29, 2020 Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street , NE Washington, D .C. 20549 -0609 Re: File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Secretary Countryman : On behalf of Life Sciences Pennsylvania (LSPA) thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC or the Commission) Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers proposed ru le (File No. S7 -08-20)1. LSPA recommends the SEC not raise the Form 13F-reporting threshold to the equity market growth - adjusted level of $3.5 billion as this will eliminate 70 percent of the information content provided by healthcare specialist investment advisors and asset managers. Data gleaned from 13(f) filings , under the existing collection threshold, is critical for corporate planning and decision -making purposes, which have bee n refined over the last few decades. Even raising the threshold to the inflation - adjusted level of $450 million will eliminate 50 percent of healthcare -specialist fund managers that are vital to emerging biotechnology companies. LSPA is the statewide trade association for Pennsylvania’s life sciences community and its membership is comprised of medical device and diagnostic companies , small biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical manufacturers, academic research institutions , patient groups and m yriad service providers that support the industry. Pennsylvania’s life sciences entities directly employ 112,000 Pennsylvanians . Our small member companies, both public and private, continue to lead efforts to address the most devastating health risks and diseases in the world, including working to develop diagnostics, devices, therapeutics , and vaccines to combat the COVID -19 pan demic. In fact, 76 percent of all global research and development (R&D) aimed at tackling the COVID -19 pandemic is generated by small biotec hnology companies.2 Small biotech nology companies are also responsible for 80 percent of all scientific R&D.3 Almost all of these companies have relied on private market financing at some point during their tenure. Indeed, more than half of the more than 2,800 life sciences entities in Pennsylvania are made -up of growing firms that employ 10 people or fewer4. LSPA supports the SEC’s path of streamlining disclosure and reporting regulations to lower the burdens of market participants and companies. However, in this instance, we believe that the policy arguments and economic analysis underpinning this proposed rule are inconsistent with the spirit of the SEC’s 1File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , SEC, July 2020. 2 BIO COVID -19 Therapeutic Development Tracker , BioCentury, Biomedtracker, and BIO, 2020. 3 Emerging Biopharma’s Contribution to Innovation , IQVIA, June 201 9. 4 Pennsylvania Life Sciences Industry , KPMG and Life Sciences PA, September 2017 recent policy path, will diminish rather than enhanc e transparency, and will creat e unintended consequences, damaging Main Street investors as well as having deleterious effects on corporate planning, particul arly in healthcare. Negative Impact on Small Company Ability to Target Specialist Investors The original intent of the 13(f) filings, as the Commission noted in their proposed rule5, was to elucidate “information about the purchase, sale, and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors” and was designed to capture a sufficiently large percentage of assets under management while minimizing the total number of re porting managers. CLSA believes that the current proposal strikes against the spirit of the law, particularly when it comes to specialist investment managers such as those that are instrumental to the success of the life sciences sector . Small and emergi ng life sciences companies rely on specialist investors to finance their niche endeavors. As these entrepreneurs work towards a new, potentially ground -breaking therapy or medical device , they rely on the long -term perspective and understanding of speciali st investors that are willing to finance the long pipelines and volatile path of translating scientific discovery into novel products. The long and uncertain product pipelines expected in the biotechnology and medical device innovation process make it ha rd for shares of small and emerging companies to be included in exchange -traded funds and mutual funds and leaves them exposed to the volatility of short -term traders and activists. 13(f) data play a critical role in knowing when and how to target these in vestors and allows life sciences companies corporate planners to formulate funding strategies that are often projected several years forward. This entire planning process has been instrumental in financing innovation for decades. Specifically, 13(f) data help s corporate planners understand the landscape, construct peer benchmarks, and further understand an investor’s preferences for research and development stage (e.g. does Investor X tend to invest in Pre -Clinical companies), preferences for therapeutic a reas (e.g. does Investor X focus on oncology therapeutics or are they agnostic), average holding period (e.g. does Investor X only hold through clinical trials phases and then exits once a product is introduced to market), and portfolio concentration (e.g. is Investor X overly exposed to oncology). Together, company planners can understand which investors to approach for which stages of corporate and product lifecycle as they synthesize a long -term financial strategy. Significant Reduction of Availa ble Holding Data In the proposal, SEC staff interpret the three primary goals of the 13(f) section of the 1975 Amendments as (1) to create a database of the investment activities of institutions, (2) to improve the body of data regarding the holdings of institutions in an effort to better understand the influence and impact of institutions on securities markets, and (3) to increase investor confidence in the U.S. equity market. CLSA also contends that the proposal, as written undercuts all thr ee goals and is inconsistent with the overall intent of the 13(f) amendments. 5 Ibid., 1 The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) examined 13(f) data accumulated and sorted by WhaleWisdom6 to find over 100 investors that are concentrated in the healthcare space. Their chart, as illustrated below, shows the median assets under managemen t (AUM) for specialist healthcare investors as $413 million, which is significantly below the SEC’s intended threshold of $3.5 billion and below the inflation -adjusted threshold of $450 million. According to BIO’s research, the proposed amendments to 13( f) will eliminate 70 percent of the information content that these filings historically supplied on the biotechnology sector . Additionally, due to the skew of the distribution of AUM in the healthcare investor sector, the chart also indicates that adjustin g the threshold by inflation would similarly remove 50 percent of the information content that has been historically supplied by 13(f) filings. As many respondents have noted already, this lack of transparency will be deleterious to Main Street investo rs and to the biotechnology sector , in particular, as it relies heavily on these data to plan financing and investor targeting strategies. In conclusion, LSPA contends that raising the threshold for 13(f) filing from $100 million to $3.5 billion will eliminate the decades -old practice of leveraging 13(f) information content for the life sciences sector’s corporate managers to better understand and engage with their shareholders, and for corporate planners to create peer benchmarks to plot their path to institutional investor holdings. As such, w e respectfully ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal. 6 https://whalewisdom.com/ Thank you for your consideration of our views.

This rule would further handicap individual investors choice and limit the discovery of new managers as the older larger ones retire. 3. One of your own SEC Commissioners has written extensively about the detrimental impact your proposed rule could have on the market place so I won't repeat her persuasive arguments here. 4. Any costs required can be addressed with a miniscule fee increase for the illuminating opportunity currently available. It is completely arbitrary for the SEC to assert $3.5billion is the new minimum management asset hurdle without commenting on individual investors who peruse all the 13F filings above $100million. 5. Removing the smaller asset managers from the 13F filing obligation implies the SEC is only concerned with mega managers so the obliteration of value identification available to elicit smaller managers is negated.

HARRISON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GENERAL COUNSEL AND SECRETARY September 29, 2020 Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, D.C. 20549- 1090 Re: Comments on Proposed Rules Relating to the Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7- 08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: In July 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”) proposed for public comment an amendment to Form 13F that would increase the 13F reporting threshold fr om $100 million to $3.5 billion (the “ Proposed Amendment ”). TEGNA Inc. (“TEGNA” or the “Company”) respectfully submits this letter in response to the Commission’ s solicitation for comments on the Proposed Amendment. With respect to the Proposed Amendment , we are concerned that it would severely limit the number of investment managers subject to Form 13F’s reporting requirements , and reduce the information availab le to public companies, stakeholders and investor s. Reducing the already limited transparency of the U.S. securities markets runs counter to the broader trend towards greater transparency and may have uncertain and negative consequences. As the Commiss ion considers whether or not to move forward with the Proposed Amendment, we believe it is imp ortant that the Commission consider more fully how 13F information is actually used by market participants (including public companies) and how important the 13F reporting regime has become to facilitating capital formation and understanding the capital ma rkets. The 13F framework has become a foundational part of how companies, the public and investors know which investment managers hold interests in public compan ies, what types of investment managers are attracted to particular companies and industries, a nd how investment manager allocations change over time. This framework is a bedrock mechanism to enable companies and other investors to consider such information across a broad set of investment managers, rather than only the absolute largest. It is als o our understanding that compliance with 13F reporting, even under the current $100 million threshold, has become a routine, cost -effective, technology- assisted a nd fairly straightforward exercise. The Proposed Amendment would significantly reduce the number of shareholders that would be visible to the companies in which they invest. It is estimated that only approximately 600 of the approximately 5,200 investment managers that filed 13Fs last quarter have over $3.5 2 billion of assets under management. 0F1 The Proposed Amendment would mean that almost 90% of investors that currently disclose their holdings would no longer be required to do so. The C ompany today has approximately 446 investors based on publicly available ownership information. Based on a nalyses provided by the Company’s proxy solicitor and stock surveillance agent, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, if the Proposed Amendment goes into effect, 182 of the Company’s shareholders (including 32 hedge funds), holding approximately 20% of the Company’s outstanding shares and representing 37.9% of its current filers, would “ go dark.” While some of the largest investment managers would continue to disclose TEGNA shares held by them , many of those managers are passive, indexed holders wi th positions that do not change appreciably each quarter . The 13F data we obtain from the active institutional investment managers, including hedge funds, is valuable and allows us to engage with our shareholders in a responsible and timely way. Many of the investment managers who would no longer be subject to mandatory 13F reporting have be en active in engaging with us and other issuers on capital allocation decisions and long- term strategy . The 13F reporting rules currently enable us – and others – to assess potential changes in their shareholdings and to consider proactive outreach to such investors. Unfortunately, outside of the 13F reporting regime, public companies do not have a clear and reliable way to identify all of their investors. Investor relations and shareholder engagement is a core part of our corporate strategy and the decision- making processes of our board of directors and management team. Accordingly, w e place great value on the input of our shareholders and regularly consult with t hem to understand what is important to them. We also strive to develop and cultivate a high- quality investor base. This includes designing approaches for targeting new inves tors who might be interested in owning our stock and for engaging with existing i nvestors who might be interested in increasing their holdings (including those who may fall well below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold). The existing threshold for report ing on 13F supports all of these important activities. 13F reports also enable us to confirm information provided by investment managers about their holdings and can prompt and inform the dialogue we have with investors. We have also found it useful to follow investment trends that are revealed by comprehensive 13F reporting, not j ust at our own Company, but also in the media industry at large, and would be disadvantaged if we were to lose some measure of that visibility. Comprehensive 13F reporting has also become an important part of public company due diligence processes in ass essing new long- term institutional investors and possible partners in potential strategic transactions. Losing access to that information would result in us not having it as an input in our capital allocation assessments and decision- making. These practi ces are helpful for our Company to effectively access the capital markets and grow our business. In addition, the loss of 13F data under the Proposed Amendment would potenti ally expose the Company to a greater risk of non- constructive shareholder activis m and undue influence by short -term-oriented investment managers, who may demand that we take measures that are inconsistent with our long- term strategy, are misaligned with the investment strategies 1 IHS Markit , “SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,” August 7, 2020, available at : https://ihsmarkit.com/research -analysis/secs -13f-proposal --issuer -and-investor -analysis.html/. 3 and priorities of our long -term investors and undermine, rather than enhance, the quality and composition of our board of directors. Research has shown that the Proposed Amendment would disproportionately reduce the 13F reporting burden on activist investors, with 86% of them no longer being subject to mandator y 13F reporting as a result. 1F2 Without the 13F data we currently receive, the Company will not know if an activist fund manager has taken a position in our stock until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more significant ) position. We also would be hindered in our efforts to engage with smaller investors to take their views into account and assess their priorities and feedback. As recently as this past proxy season, TEGNA was e ngaged in a proxy contest in which the entire management slate received majority support from our investors and were elected. The information we obtained from 13F reports was critical to us being able to engage with, understand and be responsive to our entire investor base, including our smaller investors. We would speculate that our opponents also found the transparency of our shareholder base useful in their outreac h efforts. Consistent outreach to and discussions with small yet important investors is supported by comprehensive 13F reporting. Further, the revised, higher disclosure threshold will make it more difficult for market observers to compare investors and t heir holdings. Since the Proposed Amendment, if adopted, will limit the universe of inv estment managers required to report their ownership, market observers’ ability to understand and track the evolution of investors’ holdings will be affected, especially since the holdings of many active managers will fall below the revised threshold. More broadly across all issuers, the Proposed Amendment would eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investme nt managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets. Given the sharp decreas e in the number of investment managers required to report, some may be incentivized to engage in strategic behavior, increasing or reducing their measured assets under management in order to move in and out of the reporting regime. Such unpredictable cons equences could have meaningful effects on the reporting universe and market behavior, possibly increasing volatility. This would be an unwelcome development. We are f irmly of the view that there is a broader need for reform of the Commission’s reporting rules, whether with respect to short -selling and derivatives disclosure or more timely reporting of positions under Schedule 13D and Form 13F, and would applaud the Com mission moving forward with efforts toward greater transparency and reform. We, however , question the piecemeal nature of the Proposed Amendment. One suggestion we respectfully make is to shorten the period between the end of the quarter and the required filing of the Form 13F while maintaining a threshold that is sufficiently low to ensure Form 13F remains a comprehensive and relevant regime for many investors. Investment managers who are currently required to file a Form 13F generally already use elect ronic tracking, so there is no need from a records collection point of view for the curr ent 45- day period. Shortening this period would also work towards increasing transparency in the securities markets. Another suggestion is to expand the definition of reportable securities under 13F to cover derivatives and short positions, given the emer gence of, and rapid growth in, the market for equity derivative products. In addition to our views in this letter, we write to second the arguments made in several other letters to the Commission, including those submitted by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Kat z 2 See above. 4 on September 29, 2020, the New York Stock Exchange on September 21, 2020, Nasdaq, Inc. on September 22, 2020 and the National Inves tor Relations Institute on August 28, 2020. At a time when corporat e America, and society at large, is moving toward greater transparency and engagement, it would be a regressive step for the Commission to approve the Proposed Amendment and effect such a sharp change in the opposite direction. We would be happy to respond to any questions you may have with respect to this letter or our view on the Proposed Amendment. If you have any questions or if you would like to discuss more generally, please feel free to contact the undersigned. Very truly yours, /s/ Akin S . Harrison Akin S .

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. Hello, I wanted to comment very briefly on the proposal to raise the threshold for 13Fs. Institutional investors have *so* many advantages over individual investors. 13-Fs are one tool that are a huge help to individual investors; they help level the playing field, specifically with respect to resources dedicated to research. A $1 billion fund typically generates $10- $15 million in annual fees, ignoring carried interest-- $15 million buys a lot of proprietary and street research that individual investors cannot afford. A $1 billion fund -- or even a $100 million fund-- enjoys access to company management that the individual investor does not. A move to raise filing thresholds for 13-Fs will hurt individual investors and decrease marketplace transparency. Thank you, John Randolph Stanford, CA"

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 RE: Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI), a mid -cap industrial company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposal with respect to the amendment of Form 13F reporting rules for inst itutional investment managers. Acuity would encourage the SEC to w ithdraw the proposed rule because we believe it will negatively impact market transparency and cause a loss of vital information that we depend on as a public company. Instead, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the 45 -day reporting period. Based on a review of our shareholder base, we believe that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other s imilar sized publicly traded companies in the United States. Specifically, we estimate that we would lose visibility to approximately 56% of our shareholders that are 13F filers. The rule as proposed would limit our ability to understand our overall shareh older base and reduce our ability to engage with them, reduce our ability to interact with new long -term investors, and impede our ability to identify potential activist activity. The 13F filings are the only source of quarterly ownership information avai lable to our company and other U .S. issuers. While 13F filings are not as timely as we would like them to be, it is the only data that provides access to “street name” investors that are buying or selling our shares. Unfortunately, this information cannot be fully replaced by stock surveillance firms, which typically are also using the quarterly 13F data as part of their research efforts and may be cost prohibitive over long periods of time . We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a mid-cap company, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them . While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable .1 2 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3 .5 billion threshold. Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “ SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democrac y,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed -rule-change -step-193708183.html . 2 IHS Markit estimates that 86 percent of activist i nvestors would no longer have to report their positions through 13F filings. IHS Markit, “SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,” August 7, 2020, available at: https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal - issuer -and-investor -analysis/ . Reduced Engagement Our company also uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior mana gement, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed in crease in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Identifying holders is also essential in being able to proactively engage the investment community to solicit and gain feedback on important issues such as Environmental , Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives and disclosures. It would be difficult to solicit their opinions on improving our disclosures in these areas without knowing who they are. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impe de our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our busine ss. Without this information on who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter, our company would be less able to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on public company capital format ion before proceeding with this rule making . For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its prop osed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Instit ute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.3 Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the 45 -day reporting period.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 RE: File No: S7 -08-20 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman , We commend the U .S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( the “Commission ”) for its efforts to revise the Form 13F reporting threshold to a level that supports the intended statutory goal of enabling the Commission to monitor the holdings of major investment managers .1 The proposed amendments to Form 13F ( the “Proposal ”) reflect the reality and scope of today’s equity markets , while reducing compliance and reporting burdens for smaller investment ma nagers . We appreciate the opportunity to join in this important conversati on. For perspective, MarketCounsel Consulting , LLC (“MarketCounsel”) is a regulatory compliance consulting firm to some of the country’s preeminent inde pendent investment advisers. In addition, our affiliated law firm, the Hamburger Law Firm, renders legal counsel to investment advisers, broker -dealers, hedge funds, family offices, and registered securities personnel. From its roots in 2000, MarketCounsel has been steadfast in its mission to deliver elegant solutions to the most substantial challenges faced by entrepreneurs in this fast -growing and highly -regulated industry. We write today to support raising the Form 1 3F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion . Raising the threshold acknowledges the changes in the size and structure of the U.S. equities market since 1975 and will relieve over 4,500 investment managers, many of them small bu sinesses, from unnecessarily burdensome Form 13F reporting requirements . While we support the Proposal, we feel that the Commission could clarify , and in some cases improve , its analysis in order to garner more support for the Proposal . BACKGROUND In 1975 , Congress amended the Securities and Exchange of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) to facilitate the collection and public dissemination of information concerning the holdings of and transactions in securities 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , SEC Rel. No. 34-89290 ; 85 Fed. Reg. 46016 (July 31 , 2020 ) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR -2020 -07-31/pdf/2020 -15322.pdf . PAGE 2 OF 4 by institutional investment managers .2 This amendment originated from the recommendations of a 1968 study on the effects that institutional trading had upon the maintenance of fair and orderly securities markets, the stability of those markets, and the interests of secur ities issuers and the public.3 Form 13F’s adopting release notes that section 13(f) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission broad rulemaking authority to determine the size of the institutions required to file a Form 13F as well the format and frequency of those Form 13F reports.4 Form 13F requires every institutional investment manager who exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding “ section 13(f) securities” which have an aggregate fair market value of at least $100,000,000 on th e last trading day of any month to file Form 13F .5 The Form 13F adopting release declined to choose a threshold amount lower than what was mandated by Congress in the interest of easing the reporting burden on the industry.6 While in 1999 the Commission update d the rules under section 13(f) to change t o an electronic reporting method , it has never updated the $100 million threshold.7 NEEDED RELEIF The Proposal would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion because that number tracks the growth in the value of U.S . public equites from 1975 until 2018.8 We agree that moving to a $3.5 billion report ing threshold realigns the requirement with the original intent of the rule. Other approaches such as using a consumer price inflation index, are less tied to the growth of the securities markets and, therefore , are less relevant in setting the appropriat e reporting threshold. We agree that the threshold should be based on the relative size of the U .S. equity markets. In 1975 , $100 million in disc retionary assets was consider ed a large amount for an investment manager to manage . The 1975 U.S. Senate Report concerning Section 13F found that the $100 million threshold would cover 300 institutions .9 In 2018 , 5,089 managers filed a fo rm 13F , which demonstrates that $100 million in discre tionary assets is much more common now than it was in 1975 .10 In 1975 , the intention of Congress and the Commission to was cover as large a group of investment managers as possible with the lowest possible compliance burden .11 Raising the Form 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would still cover 90% of the reported assets w hile alleviating the filing burden of more than 4,500 managers.12 2 United States, Congress, Senate, Securities Act Amendments.

Sec.gov. https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reportin g-2020 -07-10. PAGE 3 OF 4 The Proposal puts the estimate d compliance cost savings between $68.1 million and $136 million a year .13 Reducing compliance burdens, including the cost and time strain , by such an amount would be helpful for smaller investment advisers who already face significant regulatory compliance burdens . The change would reduce the compliance burden for almost 90% of the investment manager s who currently report on Form 13F , while retaining over 90% of the information currently gathered in the filings . The Commission retains almost all of t he information it has today while smaller investment advisers are freed from this burdensome reporting . RESPONDING TO CRITICISM While the Proposal seems to be an overall good idea, some have raised objections , primarily related to the Proposal’s cost -benefit analysis and the Commission ’s authority to make changes to the threshold amount . These points ar e worth addressing because the y stem from valid concerns. Addressing these objections will only serve to strengthen the Proposal . First, there is a concern that raising the threshold means that the Commission would lose visibility on $2. 3 trillion of reportable securities14. While that may be true, that amount is less than 10% of the value of the securities that the Commission is currently receiving . The Proposal acknowledges , in percentages, the information that will no longer be reported . Using big numbers like “trillions” may add to shock value, but the information that will be retained still accomplishes the Form 13F’s original intent . That intent was not to track all invest ment managers, it was to facilitate the consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public p olicy implications of that influence . The Proposal still allow s for that. The loss of less than 10% of the current data set is further alleviate d after considering a ddition al reports to Form 13F that investment managers must already file, such as Form 13D, Form 13G , Form 13H, Form PF, and Section 16 , as well as Form ADV . These additional reports provide information about large concentration s of ownership , large trading activities , the holdings of alternative investment managers and assets under management . More importantly, this objection fails to articulate a value of the lost information. In order to understand the Proposal’s cost-benefit comparison , we must place a value on the lost information. We recommend that the Commission further study this area to determine if it is possible to quantify the value of the lost information. Second , there is a concern that Commission overestimated the costs of the Form 13F compliance savings . The Proposal estimates th at the savings range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manage r, for a total of $68.1 million to $136 milli on.15 Previously , the C ommission estimated the Form 13F reporting costs at $31.2 millio n.16 We recommend that Commission review its estimate through engaging with various types of managers who may have different cost structures. However, even using the lower estimates , the Proposal is incrementally beneficial for smaller investment advisers who submit data that is relatively unimportant to support the Commission’s objectives. Finally , there is a concern that the Commission does not have the statutory authority to raise the Form 13F threshold. Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission broad rulemaking authority to determine the size of the institutions required to file reports.17 Section 13(f)(1) authorizes the Commission 13 The Proposal at 46022 . 14 Lee, Allision Herr en.

PAGE 4 OF 4 to set the reporting threshold in an amount “of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount” by rule. Section 13(f)(3) authorizes the Commission to exempt any manager or class of managers from the reporting requirements .18 In our view the Proposal is exempting small and mid -sized investment managers , a class of manager s. We believe that Congress would not have intended these investment managers to be required to file 13(f) reports. Therefore, t he Proposal does not require that section 13(f)(3) override section 13(f)(1) because the Commission is not exempting all managers from this requirement , rather i t is exempting a class of managers who do not meet the current definition of a large in stitutional manager. By raising the threshold, the C ommission is exempting managers who were not intended to be covered by the rule, but through the passage of time and the growth of the equity market find themselves over the rule ’s threshold . Readjusting the threshold returns the requirement to the origi nal legislative intent behind section 13(f). As the Commission stated in its press release, “[l] legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed so that reporting would cover a large proportion of managed assets, while minimizing the number of reporting persons .”19 CONCLUSION MarketCounsel strongly support s raising the section 13(f) reporting threshold to $3.5 billion , because it will relieve an unnecessary compliance burden for approximately 90% of investment managers , while retaining over 90% of the currently reported data. R aising the reporting threshold brings Form 13F back to the original intent of Congress : to evaluate the risks posed by the holdings of large asset managers. Raising the thresho ld provides relief for many smaller investment adviser s who are already have significant regulatory compliance and re porting obligations . We suggest that the Commission provide more detailed information involving the costs and benefits of the Proposal in the hopes that it would convince opponents that the Proposal is stripping a relatively insignificant amount of data and a proper level of information will still be available . To this end, t he Commission can engage a variety of managers based on size and investment strategy to better understand the compliance costs and burdens of Form 13F . We hope that our comments made on behalf of us , and our independent investment adviser clients , who serve investors across the country , are beneficial to this process.

CLSA recommends the SEC not raise the Form 13F -reporting threshold to the equity market growth - adjusted level of $3.5 billion as this will eliminate 70 percent of the information provided by healthcare specialist i nvestment advisors and asset managers. Data gleaned from 13(f) filings, under the existing collection threshold, is critical for investor relations and capital formation decision - making , which have been refined over the last few decades. Even raising the threshold to the inflation -adjusted level of $450 million will eliminate 50 percent of healthcare -specialist fund managers that are vital to emerging life sciences compani es. CLSA represents California’s life sciences innovators, including medical device, diagnostic, digital health, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research universities, private, non -profit institutes, and venture capital firms directly employing ove r 323,000 Californians 2. Our small member companies, both public and private, continue to lead efforts to address the most devastating health risks and diseases in the world, including working to develop diagnostics, devices, treatments, and vaccines to combat the COVID -19 pandemic. In fact, 76 percent of all global research and development (R&D) aimed at tackling the COVID -19 pandemic is generated by small biotechnology companies.3 Small biotechnology companies are also responsible for 80 percent of a ll scientific R&D.4 Almost all of these companies have relied on private market financing at some point during their tenure. California specifically, saw $6.5 billion invested in life sciences companies by venture companies in 2019.5 CLSA supports the SEC’s path of streamlining disclo sure and reporting regulations to lower the burdens of market participants and companies. However, in this instance, we believe that the policy arguments and economic analysis underpinning this proposed rule are inconsistent with the spirit of the SEC’s 1 File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Mana gers, SEC, July 2020. 2 2020 California Life Sciences Sector Report, CLSA and PwC, September 2020 3 BIO COVID -19 Therapeutic Development Tracker , BioCentury, Biomedtracker, and BIO, 2020. 4 Emerging Bioph arma’s Contribution to Innovation , IQVIA, June 2019 . 5 Ibid., 2 Comments to Securities and Exchange Commission File No. S7 -08-20 California Life Sciences Association – CLSA Page 2 recent policy path, will diminish rather than enhance transparency, and will create unintended consequences, damaging Main Street investors as well as having deleterious effects on corporate planning, particularly in healthcare. Negative Impact on Small Company Ability to Target Specialist Investors The original intent of the 13(f) filings, as the Commission noted in their proposed rule6, was to elucidate “information about the purchase, sale, and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors” and was designed to capture a sufficiently large percentage of assets under management while minimizing the total number of reporting managers. CLSA believes that the current proposal strikes against the spirit of the law, particularly when it comes to specialist investment managers such as those that are instrumental to the success of the life sciences sector . Small and emerging life sciences companies rely on specialist investors to finance their niche endeavors. As these entrepreneurs work towards a new, potentially ground -breaking therapy or medical device, they rely on the long -term perspective and understanding of specialist investors that are willing to finance the long pipelines and volatile path of translating scientific discovery into novel products. The long and uncertain product pipelines expected in the life sciences innovation process make it hard for shares of small and emerging companies to be included in exchange -traded funds and mutual funds and leaves them exposed to the volatility of short -term traders and activists . Data from 13(f) filings play a criti cal role in knowing when and how to target these investors and allows life sciences companies corporate planners to formulate funding strategies that are often projected several years forward. This entire planning process has been instrumental in financing innovation for decades. Specifically, 13(f) data helps corporate planners understand the landscape, construct peer benchmarks, and further understand an investor’s preferences for research and development stage (e.g. does Investor X tend to invest in Pre -Clinical companies), preferences for therapeutic areas (e.g. does Investor X focus on oncology therapeutics or are they agnostic), average holding period (e.g. does Investor X only hold through clinical trials phases and then exits once a product is intro duced to market), focus technologies (e.g. does investor X invest especially i n gene therapy/editing platforms), and portfolio concentration (e.g. is Investor X overly exposed to oncology). Together, company planners can understand which investors to approach for which stages of corporate and product lifecycle as they synthesize a long -term financial strategy. Significant Reduction of Available Holding Data In the proposal, SEC staff interpret the three primary goals of the 13(f) section of the 1975 Amendments as (1) to create a database of the investment activities of institutions, (2) to improve the body of data regarding the holdings of institutions in an effort to better understand the influence and impact of institutions on securities markets, and (3) to increase investor confidence in the U.S. equity market. CLSA also contends that the proposal, as written undercuts all three goals and is inconsistent with the overall intent of the 13(f) amendm ents. 6 Ibid., 1 Comments to Securities and Exchange Commission File No. S7 -08-20 California Life Sciences Association – CLSA Page 3 The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) examined 13(f) data accumulated and sorted by WhaleWisdom7 to find over 100 investors that are concentrated in the healthcare space. Their chart, as illustrated below, shows the median assets under ma nagement (AUM) for specialist healthcare investors as $413 million, which is significantly below the SEC’s intended threshold of $3.5 billion and below the inflation -adjusted threshold of $450 million. According to BIO’s research (and as echoed by other respondents, including the Advanced Med ical Technology Association [AdvaMed ]), the proposed amendments to 13(f) will eliminate 70 percent of the content that these filings historically supplied on the life sciences sector. A dditionally, due to the skew of the distribution of AUM in the healthcare investor sector, the chart also indicates that adjusting the threshold by inflation would similarly remove 50 percent of the information content that has been historically supplied b y 13(f) filings. As many respondents have noted already, this lack of transparency will be deleterious to Main Street investors and to the life sciences sector, in particular, as it relies heavily on these data to plan financing and investor targeting strateg ies. Conclusion In conclusion, CLSA contends that raising the threshold for 13(f) filing from $100 million to $3.5 billion will eliminate the decades -old practice of leveraging 13(f) information content for the life sc iences sector’s corporate managers to better understand and engage with their shareholders, and for corporate planners to create peer benchmarks to plot their path to institutional investor holdings. As such, we respectfully ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal. 7 https://whalewisdom.com/ Comments to Securities and Exchange Commission File No. S7 -08-20 California Life Sciences Association – CLSA Page 4 Thank you for your consideration of our views.

"Richard Abraham, Global Endowment Management, LP",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7859976-223853.pdf,,"550 S. Tryon Street | Suite 3500 | Charlotte, NC 28202 Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 September 2 9, 2020 Re: File Number S7 –08–20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the SEC’s proposal to amend Form 13F by raising the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion. Global Endowment Management, LP (“GEM”) is an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. GEM offers an endowment -style investment program that invests with a long -term horizon to provide a diversified, single -portfolio investment strategy for our investors, the majority of which are tax -exempt foundations and endowments. GEM’s investment strategy includes investing directly in publically traded securities in addition to investing in other private funds which invest in publically traded securities. This work positions GEM as both a 13F filer and a user of other 13F filers’ information. Our views and opinions described below come from both of these perspectives. In the proposal under section I(B), the Commi ssion notes the following rationale for adopting the 13F disclosure program proposed in 1975 and implemented in 1978: “The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutiona l investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” 2 We believe that the proposed substantial increase of the 13F rep orting threshold is counterproductive to all three of these stated goals of the 13F disclosure program. We further believe that (i) the regulatory burden of quarterly reporting from both a time and cost perspective is very small in the digital age and (ii) the lost transparency associated with the increase in threshold is unwarranted. Unclear benefit of reduced regulatory burden GEM appreciates any effort the SEC makes to ease compliance burdens. However, as a 13F filer for many years, we do not find the filing to be costly nor burdensome. The analysis in the proposal that follows the above rationale notes the increase in both the number of reporting managers and the size of the U.S. equity market. Although the analysis recognizes gains in technology, we believe the proposed rule underestimates the enormous increase in computing power and automation over the past few decades. Modern portfolio accounting systems, and even simple spreadsheets, can easily account for and report out on investment managers’ portfolios to comply with 13F filing requirements. One certainly hopes that a person or firm managing securities with a value of $100 million or more has some means of technology at their disposal for proper recordkeeping of their investment holdings. At G EM, we estimate it takes a total of 2 hours of internal time and costs $125.00 of external service provider expense each quarter to prepare and file our 13F filing. Eliminating this time and expense does not provide material relief from a regulatory burden on our firm. Large Cost of Reduced Transparency Importantly, t he substantial increase in the 13F reporting threshold will cause additional costs , including those attributable to the los s of market transparency for investment managers . GEM uses the 13F reports to monitor private fund investments at a positi on level which may otherwise be opaque. Since nearly all of our current private fund managers that trade in public equities manage assets below the proposed $3.5 billion filing threshold, thi s monitoring ability will be practically eliminated. As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary obligation to oversee and manage the investments we make on behalf of our clients, and this loss of transparency will severely impair our ability to do so. Some examples of the benefit of transparency provided by the 13F filings include : consolidating total exposure to individual companies across all of our external managers; monitoring the investment concentration of our external managers; and monitoring ou r external managers for style or strategy drift. 3 Our endowment and non- profit clients, the entities which the SEC aims to protect, depend on us to perform this work without undue expense. Ironically, an increase in the 13F threshold will actually lead to an increase in expense and burden due to the alternate means which will be required to gather the information required to properly monitor our external managers. Summary In conclusion, we recommend t hat the SEC should not adopt the proposed rule. There is no real compliance cost or burden to speak of, and the increased reporting threshold will unequivocally harm the investing community, including the clients of investment advisers, by significantly reducing the transparency of U.S. capital markets. Yours truly, Global Endowment Management, LP Richard S. Abraham Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer"
"Mark Fuller, Investor",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223859.htm,,"Sep. 29, 2020 Subject: File No. S7-08-20 From: Mark Fuller Affiliation: Investor -------------------------- September 29, 2020 Transparency in financial markets is a cornerstone of capitalism. In an age where retail investors are inundated with data and information, and are often exposed to professional hedge fund investors via TV and numerous other forums. It is often difficult to discern however if their views are truly that they believe or if those managers are just talking up their book. The Form 13F plays a pivotal role in helping investors understand those managers holdings and therefore better assess the market information they have received. Significantly increasing the threshold for 13F reporting would undermine this transparency and be negative to our financial markets."

Guyer, Invitae Corporation, CFO",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860038-223895.pdf,,"September 28 , 2020 Via Email Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -82920; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: I write on behalf of Invitae Corporation (“Invitae” or the “Company”)1 to provide feedback regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “Commission”) propos ed amendments to Rule 13f -1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and corresponding proposed increase to the Form 13F reporting threshol d from $100 million to $3.5 billion . As discussed below, we believe that the proposed amendments would substantially decrease market transparency , impose significant costs and other burdens on publicly traded companies , and reduce capital formation and st rategic business combinations . We therefore respectfully request that the Commission decline to adopt the proposed amendments. Invitae is a mid-cap company focused on advanced medical genetics and founded on the mission of making comprehensive genetic information part of mainstream medicine . We are currently focused on providing genetic testing for adult and pediatric inherited disease as well as reproductive health . The Company earned approximate ly $21 7 million in revenue in 2019 and employ s approximately 1,500 individuals worldwide . The Proposed Amendments Would Decrease Transparency and Investor Engagement As an overarching matter, Form 13F filings are the sole accurate source of information r egarding the identity of institutional shareholders of U.S. issuers. Based on the most recent ly available data, we estimate that raising the Form 13F reporting threshold to $3.5 billion would prevent Invitae from having any visibility into the identity of approximately 10 percent of our shareholders. We note that this percentage was even higher when we were a smaller cap company (as recently as last year), as small -cap issuers generally attract investors with fewer assets under management. While larger c ompanies may have the ability to conduct extensive investor surveillance to compensate for this deficit (presumably at a considerable cost), small and mid-cap companies —such as Invitae —have no reasonable mechanism to obtain this critical data. The loss of this data —and accompanying decrease in transparency regarding the identity of investors —will be detrimental to public companies. Indeed, p ublic companies rely extensively on 1 Invitae’s common stock is registered under Section 12 (b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NVTA.” Vanessa Countryman, Secretary September 28 , 2020 Pg. 2 Form 13F data to guide a wide variety of interactions with investors . On a weekly basis, Invitae receives and responds to approximately ten purported shareholder inquiries. To properly address these inquiries, Invitae must be able to determine (among other things) whether a communication is actually from a shareholder and whe ther that shareholder is a long -term investor. Raising the Form 13F reporting threshold would diminish our ability to make these determinations, and thus frustrate Congress’s primary purpose in enacting Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act, which was to increase the availability of information regarding ownership of securities by institutional investors.2 The Commission has recently —and repeatedly —emphasized the importance of market transparenc y.3 Invitae agrees with the Commission’s expressly stated views on this subject , and suggests that the impact of increas ing the Form 13F threshold should be considered in the context of other recent actions and proposals that may undermine the Commission’s transparency related goals .4 Raising the Form 13F Threshold Would Impede Is suers’ Compliance with Other Legal Requirements In addition to decreasing our ability to effectively identify and engage with our shareholders, the proposed amendments would make it difficult for the Company —and other issuers —to comply with various regulatory and corporate requirements. By way of example, the process of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval s for certain transactions would become increasingly difficult and costly . As the Commission is a ware, securities exchange rules, state corporate law , and the governing documents of many issuers require stockholder approval for a variety of transactions including issuance s of securities and amending a certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Creating additional hurdles to companies identifying shareholders would hinder the ability of companies to effectuate these and other important transactions, many of which can be time sensitive. While companies can hire proxy solicitation firms to assist in obtain ing the requisite shareholder approvals, it is both costly and time consuming to do so . These costs are likely to be particularly burdensome for small - and mid -cap issuers, including Invitae. 2See Section 13(f) Confidential Treatment Requests, Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Inv estment Management (June 17, 1998) (“ Congress enacted Section 13(f) to increase the public availability of information regarding the purchase, sale, and holdings of securities by institutional investors .”). 3See, e.g. , Chairman Jay Clayton, Governance an d Transparency at the Commission and in Our Markets (Nov. 8, 2017), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech -clayton -2017 -11-08; Chairman Jay Clayton, Modernizing our Regulatory Framework (Nov. 14, 2019), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/sp eech/clayton - modernizing -our-regulatory -framework -111419. 4Commissioner Lee’s Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2010) at n.2 (citing example s). Vanessa Countryman, Secretary September 28 , 2020 Pg. 3 The Proposed Rule Would Impede Capital Formation and Decrease Opportunities for U.S. Investors Finally, the proposed amendments would impede capital formation —a vital component of the Commission’s three -part mission.5 Invitae —and many other issuers —rely extensively on Form 13F data to identify current shareholders from whom to raise additional capital when the need arises. Additionally, Invitae —and many other issuers —also utilize 13F data to identify new prospective investors ( i.e., those wh o have invested in similar companies). The proposed amendments would r educ e the volume of information available in 13F disclosures and drastically undermine the data’s utility for identifying sources of potential capital. As a result, the process of raising funding would become longer, more expensive, and ultimately less certain. We are simply not aware of any other source of information upon which we can rely for the extensive shareholder information that will disappear if the proposed amendments are ad opted. Over the course of his tenure, Chairman Clayton has aspired to encourage additional companies to enter U.S. public markets.6 Because issuers have a strong interest in knowing the identity of their stockholders (for the reasons discussed above) , the proposed amendments would likely deter private companies from going public or incentivize them to pursue capital through foreign public markets. The Commission has recently recognized the enhanced risk faced by U.S. investors when they invest in comp anies that are listed overseas.7 *** Although the Commission’s proposed rule discusses the potential economic impact on investment managers, it is silent regarding the benefits and costs with respect to public companies.8 We respectfully request that in light of th e substantial costs that would be imposed on U.S. issuers — among th e other considerations discussed in this comment letter —the Commission decline to adopt the proposed amendments.9 Additionally, Invitae supports the position outlined in the 2013 petition by the National Investor Relations Institute , the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Society for Corporate 5About the SEC, What we do , available at https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html . 6See, e.g. , Testimony of Chairman Jay Clayton on Oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing , and Urban Affairs (Dec. 10, 2019). 7See International Investing, SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (Dec. 8, 2016), available at https://www.s ec.gov/reportspubs/investor -publications/investorpubsininvesthtm.html . 8See generally , SEC Release No. 34 -89290, Reporting Thresholds for Institutional Investment Managers, File No. S7-08-20. 9Commissioner Lee’s Statement on the Proposal to Substan tially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2010) at 1 (opining that the proposed amendments “lack[] a sufficient analysis of the costs and benefits” and noting “[t]he Commission’s legal obligation to do a thorough analysis under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act … .”).

As a publicly- traded BDC, Prospect Capital is writing to express its opposition to the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers (the “Proposed Amendments”), as proposed in Release No. 34- 89290 (the “Proposing Release”). Currently, Rule 13f -1, which implements Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requires that mana gers file quarterly reports on Form 13F if they exercise investment discretion over accounts that hold, in aggregate, $100 million or more in Section 13(f) securities on the last trading day of any month of any calendar year. The Commission’s proposal to r aise this $100 million reporting threshold to $3.5 billion (a 35- fold increase that far outpaces price inflation since the initial threshold was adopted in 1978 1) would effectively eliminate Form 13F reporting obligations for 4,539 of the 5,089 managers ( 89.2%) currently required to file quarterly 13F reports.2 In adopting Rule 13f -1, the Commission sought to implement a congressional directive to create within the Commission a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers, and thereby to 1) improve the body of factual data available and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy impli cations of that influence and 2) permit establishment of uniform reporting standards and a uniform centralized 1 According to the Proposing Release, utilizing the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index inflation standard through 2018, the threshold would be $358 million; while using the Consumer Price Index inflation standard through 2018, the threshold would be $453 million.

Proposing Release at 15- 16. 2 Proposing Release at 11; Proposing Release at n.45. 2 data base maintained by the Commission.3 The Commission recognized in adopting subsequent amendments to Rule 13f -1 that “[s]ince the information on Form 13F is useful to both investors and issuers and the amendments will increase the amount of such information available on a timely basis to issuers and the investing public, the amendments are appropriate in the public interest and for the protecti on of investors,” and further that “rapid dissemination of the institutional disclosure information to the public is a fundamental purpose of the bill” enacting Section 13(f). 4 The Proposed Amendments frustrate this fundamental purpose of Section 13(f). Publicly - traded registered closed -end funds and BDCs (together, “CEFs”) in particular would be severely and adversely impacted in ways that may not have been fully considered by the Commission if they lose access to the great majority of the useful inform ation publicly disseminated in Form 13F as a result of the Proposed Amendments. 1. Shareholder Engagement and Good Corporate Governance While the current 13F process is viewed by some as imperfect, 5 it does provide CEFs a quarterly snapshot of their shareholder base, which allows the fund to engage with its shareholders throughout the year, hear their concerns and participate in best governance practices. As revised, the Proposal curtails a CEF’s abi lity to so identify and engage with its shareholders. When adopting rules requiring the filing of Form 13F via EDGAR, the Commission noted that “investors would find the information contained in Form 13F filings useful in tracking institutional investor holdings in their investments and . . . issuers . . . would find detail as to institutional investor holdings useful because much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.”6 The Proposing Release doe s not explain how the loss of this useful information is outweighed by the purported cost savings for 13F filers.7 As other commenters have noted, 13F filings are the only accurate means of tracking institutional holdings. 8 Although larger issuers may ha ve the resources to hire “stock surveillance firms,” 3 Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 14852 (June 15, 1978). 4 S.

Solicitation for Meetings under the 1940 Act CEFs are subject to more stringent meeting and quorum requirements under the 1940 Act. 9 Listed closed -end funds, like other listed issuers, are required by their exchanges to hold a shareholder meeting annually for the election of directors. In addition, however, the 1940 Act generally requires a shareholder vote for other matters, including the approval of an advisory contract, the election of directors, and the selection of an accountant to certify financial statements. Further, funds seeking to engage in corporate reorganizations must hold meetings to obtain shareholder approval of such pl ans under state law. CEFs regulated under the 1940 Act face challenges in soliciting proxy votes for such matters that operating companies generally do not face. Unlike most operating companies where the majority of the outstanding shares are held by inst itutional investors, a significant portion of CEF stockholders are retail investors who generally hold smaller numbers of shares than institutional investors. Funds often find it difficult and expensive to satisfy quorum requirements on “non- routine” matte rs (i.e. , those matters where brokers do not have discretion to vote on behalf of beneficial holders), merely because retail shareholders are less likely to vote at all, regardless of whether they may favor a proposal. Over the past several years, the percentage of retail ownership in CEFs has been increasing. 10 The general low retail shareholder participation rate makes the proxy process both difficult and expensive. It also leads to a number of risks, including that a proposal may not be approved or th at quorum requirements may not be satisfied, causing the Company to adjourn its meeting and pay additional solicitation expenses in an effort to locate more shareholders and motivate them to vote. If such efforts are unsuccessful, a fund might be faced wit h even more difficult problems and potential violations of the 1940 Act ( e.g., a lapsed investment advisory agreement in violation of Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act) or might need to abandon a proposed transaction that shareholders might have viewed as bene ficial. In addition, although state law, as well as a fund’s organizational documents, governs quorum and meeting requirements, the 1940 Act requires certain actions to be approved by a special standard known as the “1940 Act Majority,” which is enumerate d in the 1940 Act to require either (1) that more than half of the fund’s shares vote in favor of a proposal or (ii) that more than half of a fund’s shares be represented at the shareholder meeting, and 67% of those shares vote in favor of a proposal. In light of the high percentage of retail shareholders and these high voting thresholds, funds need to convince a large number of shareholders to vote at all in order to meet the quorum 9 Generally, see Jennifer R. Gonzalez and Shane C. Shannon, “Regulatory Monitor: SEC Update,” The Investment Lawyer, Volume 26, No. 8 (Aug. 2019). 10 Id. 4 requirement that is statutorily imposed. Funds typically have attempted t o do so by mailing additional solicitation materials or calling shareholders directly. One of the few means by which a 1940 Act fund can improve its chances at obtaining a quorum is by using the information contained in Form 13F to identify, locate, and solicit existing shareholders. Without this information, it is likely that many CEFs would encounter greater difficulty in meeting quorum requirements. 3. Defense Against Opportunistic Activists It is well known that CEFs, which often trade at a discount to their net asset value, are particularly susceptible to activist attacks and pressure. As the Investment Company Institute recently noted in a report provided to the Commission:11 In recent yea rs, activist investors have intensified their efforts to seize a controlling interest in closed -end funds to pursue a self -interested agenda to extract short -term profits. These arbitrage tactics cause serious harm to funds and work against the interests of their long- term investors, including forcing fundamental changes to the products that are contrary to what stockholders sought when making their investment. Activists also can demand actions that can cause funds to shrink in size or be liquidated altoget her, thereby reducing the availability of closed- end funds to investors and increasing costs. Decreasing the number of closed -end funds harms a large demographic of closed- end fund shareholders —including retirees many of whom rely on the dividends from closed - end funds. CEFs depend upon Form 13F filings to monitor for and ultimately defend against attacks by opportunistic activist investors. The Commission’s mathematical estimate that managers controlling 90.8% of currently - reported assets would continue t o file under the revised thresholder fails to consider the nature of the assets and managers in question. Although the securities markets have undoubtedly increased in size and trading volume since the currently effective 100 million threshold was establis hed, the structure of the markets themselves has transformed. It would be anathema to the principles underlying Section 13(f) to increase the reporting thresholder for 13F filers to such a great extent without consideration of who, exactly, files the 13F r eports in modern times, who relies on the reports, and in what way. For example, many of the largest holders of 13(f) securities are passive and indexed, meaning that they are not likely to launch activist attacks. A number of well -known hedge fund execu tives and billionaire investors would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long- term basis. 12 Issuers whose shares may publicly trade at a discount to net asset value, like ma ny CEFs, are much more 11 Investment Company Institute, Recommendations Regarding the Availability of Closed- End Fund Takeover Defenses (March 2020). 12 Letter from National Investor Relations Institute (Aug. 28, 2020); Bloomberg News (Quint), “Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC Plan,” July 15, 2020. 5 concerned with the holdings of these active investment managers and hedge funds that would fall below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. Increasing the reporting thresholder to exclude approximately nine in ten asset managers will obfuscate a CEF’s visibility into the trading activities of the very activists that it needs to be monitoring. The Staff of the Division of Investment Management, in recently withdrawing a former interpretive position limiting the ability of closed -end funds to utilize certain statutory antitakeover mechanisms, has recognized feedback from the closed- end fund industry highlighting the vulnerability of closed- end funds to activist attacks , and acknowledged that “the number of listed closed- end funds has decl ined considerably” in recent years.13 This is in part due to the vulnerability of CEFs to the activists who seek to force the funds to consolidate or “open -end” in an effort to turn a quick profit, regardless of whether the fund’s board determines that suc h actions would otherwise be in the fund shareholder’s long- term best interests. The aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008- 2009 saw a significant increase in shareholder activism, as activists were able to cheaply acquire significant ownership stakes i n issuers at recession -induced prices. There is no reason to believe that activists will shy away from exploiting the same opportunities in the aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic. For many years, Form 13F filings have been the sole means by which CEFs can effectively monitor smaller positions taken in fund securities by known activist investors, and therefore take the appropriate steps to protect the fund in the best interests of fund shareholders, including engagement with existing shareholders, engagement with the activist, and taking steps to proactively address concerns voiced by shareholders or the activist. Under the Proposed Rules, CEFs would be unaware of activist activity until the activist “surfaces” by filing a Schedule 13D revealing a 5% or greater ownership stake in the CEF, leaving CEFs vulnerable to activist “sneak attacks.” Conclusion We are grateful for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Amendments. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw the Proposed Ame ndments and instead consider the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. CEFs, which fulfill crucial role in meeting the needs of “ Main Street” investors, including retirees, rely on transparent and fulsome ownership information not only in promoting good corporate governance and shareholder engagement, but in efficiently satisfying the quorum and meeting requirements directly imposed upon them by statute, and, in more dire circumstances, in fighting for their survival against self -interested activists. 13 Staff Statement: Control Share Acquisition Statutes, Division of Investment Management (May 27, 2020)."

My financial experience stems from work with a well-known financial services firm , whose market value falls well beyond the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. As stated in the legislative history “the reporting threshold of sec tion 13(f) was designed so that reporting would cover a large proportion of managed assets, while minimizing the number of reporting persons”. Today , there are over 5,000 firms included amongst 13F filers, and that number is going to continue to grow if th e threshold is not adjusted. I would imagine that when the rule was initially promulgated , the Commission would expect those numbers to grow over time; thus, the threshold would have to be revisited periodically. The rule was also geared toward s tracking equity positions of large institutional investors ; however, with the $100 million threshold , small advisory firms are on the long list of 13F filers today . Since the rule was initially promulgated in 1978 , the value of the U.S. securities market has grown from $1.1 trillion then to $35.6 trillion today. I am surprised that it took this long to consider a change. Additionally, I would actually suggest going a step further and increasing the proposed $3.5 bill ion threshold to $4 billion . This still captures 90 percent of the dollar value of those who report currently , while reducing the number of filers by roughly 10%. An increase in this amount would still satisfy the three main goals laid out in the proposed rule. Large investment firms can afford to hire the compliance personnel a s well as employ the technology needed to accurately complete the filing. In fact, I would imagine that with the scale at which these large firms operate , many of the systems that t hey have in place automatically track the information needed for the 13F filing. Additionally, these firms are usually equipped with in -house counsel that is able to ensure they are in compliance with the filing. Whereas, smaller firm s need to look outward to ensure that they are in compliance. This could include purchasing a system or services needed to help with filing that they might not otherwise need, as well as the need to hire outside counsel . These costs are then passed down to their investors. While large financial services firms have the scale to minimize costs to clients, smaller boutique firms may need to impose larger fees on their clients. More to th e point of adjusting the threshold to excuse smaller firms is the fact tha t 13F filings are notorious for their errors and often time s inaccurate information .1 In fact, in 2013 the Commission added to 13F documents that a reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete .2 It appears as though the SEC has spread itself too thin and adjusting the threshold requirement may give the Commission the space it needs to take control of the situation. With fewer firms needing oversight , the Commission can check for inaccuracies and hold filers accountable for their errors , or at the very least encourage these firms to amend their filings . This will do a tremendous amount of good in the way of promoting transparency . 1 Anne Anderson & Paul Brockman, An Examination of 13F Filings , 41 J. FIN. RES. 295, 300 (2018) 2 Id. at 298 With regard to transparency, we find a similar situation where less of something leads to a more desirable outcome . Respectfully, w hile large corporations can benefit from the raw data generated by these filings through develop ing business strategy or corporate governance , the truth of the matter is that many institu tional investors (and their clients) benefit when the ir holdings remain confidential . Disclosure in this instance makes public proprietary information that these institutional investors hope to keep confidential. While these firms can request to have the proprietary information remain confidential, in certain instances it may not be worth the effort . Transparency in this instance can have a negative effect on the institutional investor, and also on those who might look to emulate what is listed in the filings. It is widely known that information that is disclosed by institutional investors in these 13F filings has been used by their competitors and individual investors in an attempt to replicate a successful strategy. However, as stated earlier, these filings are often inaccurate . This could have serious downstream effect . Alternatively, i t is important to note that a large net is still being cast. Under the new threshold , 75% of the existing US equities market would still be captured, compared with 40% when the rule was initially promulgated.3 The filing is still there and there will still be a relatively large bank of data for corporations and individual investors concerned with the proposed threshold to consider when strategizing. Alternatively, a djusting to the proposed threshold will have little to no effect on investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. s ecurities markets . In conclusion, the legislative history indicates that the purpose w as to track the equit y holdings of large institutional investors, while the current landscape paints a much broader 3 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , 85 Fed.

Also, large investment firms have the scale and infrastructure needed to be able to comply with the 13F filing s. Under the new threshold, the Commission may be able to reduce its workload and create a more accurate and reliable portrait of the cur rent U.S. securities market. Therefore, I submit this comment in favor of 85 Fed. Reg. 46016, and encourage that the Co mmission considers increasing the proposed threshold to $4 billion . Respectfully, REC"

(NYSE: CTVA), a global pure- play agriculture company providing seed, crop protection and digital solutions headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, we are writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. M ore specifically, we respectfully request the Commission give further consideration to the negative consequences of the 35-fold proposed increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, which would result in reducing the number of current 13F filers by nearly 90% . 1 While we welcome the Commission’s interest in modernizing Form 13F reporting, we believe reforms should be consistent with the original intent of Section 13(f) to improve transparency for all market participants and increase investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets. 2 Negative Impacts from Reduced Transparency At the time of Corteva’s spin from DowDuPont, Inc. in 2019, it became one of the first stand -alone publicly traded pureplay agriculture companies. Because of our single industry focus, educating and engaging investor and potential investors on the dynamics 1 See Press Release, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , SEC Proposes Amendments to Update Form 13F for Institutional Investment Managers; Amend Reporting Threshold to Reflect Today’s Equities Markets (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152. 2 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Office of Audits, Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements, Report No. 480 (September 27, 2010), at iv. 2 of our industry is critica l. In order to facilitate this process , we ex tensively use 13F filings to aid our s hareholder engagement efforts , as they are the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. If the Commission’s proposal were enacted as of September 9, 2020, we would have lost visibility to 64.2% of Corteva’s total current 13F filers. Th erefore, this substantial decrease in transparency would significantly reduce our ability effectively engage with our investors. Despite the original intent of 13F to increase transparency for all market participants3, the Commission’s proposed amendments would result in the loss of transparency to the activities of more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets. 4 Like many companies, the data within 13F filings provides us assistance in identifying potential investors (su ch as those who have invested in peer companies) and in measuring the effectiveness of our engagement efforts with prospective and current investors. Both of these practices are important to ensuring ongoing access to the capital markets and the future gr owth of our business.5 Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies with whom they invest. Investors have become more active in engaging with public companies on many important matters, including capital allocation decisions, long- term strategy, mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, and sustainability. Moreover, the Commission has encouraged this engagement and recognized investor engagement as benefit ting capital markets and investors generally . 6 Therefore, we respectfully request that the Commission consider the negative impact and the costs of the lost transparency that would result from the proposed amendments and evaluate 3 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Office of Inspect or General, Office of Audits , Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements, Report No. 480 (September 27, 2010), at iv. 4 See Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2020), avai lable at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020- 07-10. 5 To this end, in addition to the negative impacts related to shareholder engagement and access to capital markets, the Commission should consider the long -term impact of its proposed amendments on U.S. public markets if enacted, as the amendments may ultimately discourage companies f rom going public or prompt companies to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency regarding their ownership positions . 6 See, e.g ., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “What We Are Doing to Enhance Shareholder Engagement,” available at https://www.sec.gov/what- we-are-doing -improve -shareholder -engagement .

Opportunities to Modernize 13F Reporting While we welcome the Commission’s interest in modernizing Form 13F reporting, we believe opportunities to modernize Form 13F should be aligned to create greater transparency and reflect the significant changes to the capital markets since the adoption of Form 13F9. These capital markets changes include the significant expansion of the market for equity deriv ative products , which are not completely addressed by the current Form 13F10. Transparency is ultimately aided through timely reporting and the Commission has long recognized the importance of revising reporting deadlines to address improvements in information technology and evolving capital markets . Commensurate with the advancements in technology and the significant changes to our capital markets since the adoption of Form 13F , we urge the Commission to adopt Form 13F reforms, which reduce the 45 -day reporting deadline , require the disclosure of short positions, and align with Dodd- Frank legislation to provide for monthly disclosure.11 Conclusion For the forgoing reasons, we request that the Commission reconsider the implications and costs that would result from the proposed amendments and focus its Form 13F reporting 7 See Securities and Exchange Commission, What We Do, available at https://www.sec.go/Article/whatwedo.html (“The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.”) 8 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Office of Audits, Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements, Report No. 480 (September 27, 2010), at iv. 9We believe calls to modernize Form 13F disclosures towards greater transparency are widely preferred by numerous capital market participants .

We believe that the proposed amendments if adopted would undermine the original intent of Form 13F and the Commission’s efforts to increase shareholder engagement and transparency.

FCE is a small cap company publicly traded since 1992. Monitoring and engaging with our investor base is critical to our success as a public company. Our efforts would be severely undermined by the Commission’s proposal. In fact, under the Commission’s proposed threshold of $3.5 billion, the ma jority of FCE’s current institutional investors would avoid disclosure. This would make it impossible for FCE to engage with smaller investors who may be interested in increasing their holdings in our company, identify potential activist investors amassing shares or even reach ou t to shareholders to ensure their concerns are being adequately addressed by the company. Like many other smaller publicly traded companies, we also use 13F data to identify potential new investors in our company by reaching out to those who have invested in similar companies. This has been an essential strategy for FCE to grow its investor base. The Commission’s proposed rule would definitely impede our ability to raise growth capital, which is contrary to the Commission’s mission and purpose. Stock surveillance firms would not be able to fill t his gap, as many themselves rely on 13F data in providing their services.

As I am sure you know, 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to corporate issuers. While 13F filings are not as timely as they could be, they are the only data source that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our sen ior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one- on-one calls and meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors, but also shareholders who have or could significantly increase their positions in our stock. With this proposed increase in the threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. In fact, we estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F t hreshold to $3.5 billion would impact over 31% of our current institutional shareholders , including three of our top- 15 largest shareholders. The loss of this essential 13F data also would impede our ability to identify, attract and engage with new long-term institutional investors. Like many other mid -cap issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Like other similarly sized companies, our shareholder base has turned over several times since our initial public offering in 2014. But for 13F data, we would not have been able to efficiently manage the constant transition in shareholders, which ultimately would have negatively impacted 2 our valuation. Our ability to efficiently and effectively access the capital markets is co ntingent on develop ing and execut ing a highly strategic and proactive investor engagement program to attract the attention of, and ultimately ownership from institutional investors. In short, we don’t have the luxury of simply waiting for investors to come to us; we must go them, and in order to do that effectively, we need to know more information (not less) about the institutional investment community. For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments . Instead , we encourage the Commission to pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq .1 Rather than reduc e 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20; Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, The Security Traders Association (“STA”) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC” or the “Commission”) Proposed Rule on Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (“Proposal”). STA is an organization comprised of individuals who are involved in the trading of financial securities in the U.S and Canada (“CSTA”). Our members represent companies with many of the business models in the financial services sector including, but not limited to, retail brokerage firms, agency only broker dealers, asset owners and managers, and liquidity providers. STA’s remarks are focused primarily on the Commission’s Proposal to raise the reporting thresholds and the potential n egative implications of the Proposal, including the impact on the secondary trading of thinly traded securities.1 Background In 1978, the Commission implemented the reporting requirement of Section 13(f) by adopting rule 13f -1 and Form 13F. The proposal explains the Commission “attempted to structure the form in a manner that would provide useful data regarding holdings that cou ld impact the markets, while minimizing the form’s reporting burdens.” Proposed Rule Summary The Commission is proposing the following three substantive changes:2 1 See Securities and Exchange Commission Statement on Market Structure Innovation for Thinly Traded Securities, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87327 (October 17, 2019), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/p olicy/2019/34 -87327.pdf (the “Commission Statement”). 2 See Reporting Threshold for Institutional Asset Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34 -89290 (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf . [hereinafter Reporting Threshold Proposal]. page 2 • Proposal to increase the current reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers from $100 million in assets under management (“AUM”) to $3.5 billion AUM. • Proposal to increase the information provided by institutional investment managers by eliminating the omission threshold for Form 13F.3 • Proposal to amend the instructions related to confidential treatment requests on Form 13F in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media , 139 S. Ct. 2356 (2019). Summary of Recommendation Shareholder information from For m 13F Filings is required for the efficient trading of securities and useful in the investment decisions by self -directed retail investors. The Proposal would eliminate the public visibility of large amounts of shareholder information that will lead to a l oss of liquidity in the secondary markets and result in harm for companies and their shareholders. This outcome would be more severely felt in thinly traded securities given their inherent need for enhanced liquidity provision by broker dealers. STA ack nowledges that the current reporting threshold presents burdens on certain small investment managers, but given the importance of the information from Form 13F we recommend that the Commission exercise extreme caution in raising the reporting threshold. We believe a threshold which is materially lower than the proposed $3.5 billion AUM will more effectively balance the interests of small investment managers; issuers and the investors they serve. Reporting Burden for Investment Advisors Centralized Book of Records Some small managers do not utilize a centralized book of record, resulting in manual workflow for filling out a Form 13F. For those managers who also offer a Separately Managed Accounts (“SMA”) service, the burden is meaningful because it requires the investment manager to pull holdings information from multiple custodians of those investors whom they manage assets for. This workflow of centralizing books of records, necessary in filing a Form 13F, is a manual 3 Form 13F currently allows a reporting institutional investment manager to omit from its Form 13F otherwise reportable holdings of Section 13(f) securities if, on the period end date, it holds “fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amoun t in the case of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggregate fair market value (and option holdings to purchase only such amounts). See Form 13F Instructions, Special Instruction 10, available at https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form13f.pd f. page 3 process for small managers who may not possess the resources to pay a vendor to produce an accurate Form 13F report. Burden of Paperwork Today there is less handling of physical paper, however, firms still have to create reports, which includes procuring, amalgamating, and reporting the data. Firms are further required to store the back -up information, obtain confirmation of filing, and retain all of the records. Thinly Traded Securities Correlation between Thinly Traded Securities; Their Investors and Broker Dealers Consolidation among the asset management and broker dealer industries have led to fewer, but much larger players in the marketplace. Achieving profitability for large asset managers requires sizable investments in issues with meaningful markets cap italizations. For large broker dealers, profitability is mainly achieved through large transactions with large asset managers and companies. Therefore, as it pertains to thinly traded securities, it is predominately small to mid - size investment managers wh o invest in them and small to mid -size broker dealers who provide execution and investment services. In addition to small to mid -size investment managers, other shareholders in thinly traded securities are individual investors who engage the market throu gh a self -directed vehicle. STA acknowledges certain benefits accrue to investors when they engage the market in a self - directed vehicle with information from Form 13F filings. In our letter to the Commission dated March 26, 2013 we define “self -directed v ehicle” as a product used by an investor who chooses to make their own investment decision absent any advisor and executes that investment directly without the use of an advisor or manager.4 An individual investor who chooses to use such vehicles may dete rmine there is a benefit in knowing that professional managers with robust research and investment models are shareholders in a company in which the individual investor seeks to invest in. This information therefore contributes to overall confidence and i s a contributing factor in the investment and liquidation decisions for these individual investors. There is a strong correlation between thinly traded securities, their investors, and the broker dealers who service them. Therefore, in order to maintain a robust ecosystem for thinly traded 4 See STA Comment Letter re NYSE Petition for Rulemaking under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; File No. 4 -659, available at https://securi tytraders.org/wp - content/uploads/CommentLetterShortening13Ffilings.pdf . page 4 securities, rulemaking which addresses one segment of these participants needs to also take into consideration the impact to the other two. Enhanced Liquidity STA believes that small to mid -size broker dealers play a critical role in the quality of the secondary markets of thinly traded securities because, unlike exchanges, they are able to provide enhanced liquidity to investors. Enhanced liquidity is liquidity that exceeds what is publicly displayed and available in the marketplace. Enhanced liquidity could be the result of capital commitment, secondary offerings, or institutional block trades. Information found in Form 13F filings play a meaningful role in decisions which foster the creation of enhanced liquidity. B roker dealers will be less inclined to commit capital absent accurate information on shareholders who could be on the “other side” of the transaction that the broker dealer is being asked to commit capital on. Institutional Block Trading & Third -Party Ve ndors Even in situations where the broker dealer is acting in an agency capacity, institutional block trading would be impeded absent shareholder information from investment advisors. Absent the Form 13F reporting information, broker dealers facilitating orders would need to acquire this information elsewhere, such as from a third -party vendor. Besides broker dealers incurring a new and additional cost, it is highly likely that the information would be inferior to what is currently available due to regulat ory requirement for investment managers to report such information no longer existing. Regulatory Industry Standards STA believes benefits can accrue to individual investors when regulators, with industry input, define industry standards in appropriate areas. Defined regulatory industry standards ensure information is accurate and uniformly available. In addition, such standards foster private market solutions which transcend to lower costs. Information found in Form 13F is an example of a re gulatory industry standard which produces information that is accurate and uniformly available with low cost burdens. The Proposal goes against this principle because by eliminating the reporting requirement for investment advisors with under $3.5 billion AUM, the breadth of required information will decrease; become more expensive to replace; and be less standardized. page 5 Achieving Regulatory Efficiency The U.S. securities markets are the most efficient and liquid in the world. In order to maintain these standards, participants, including regulators, must operate efficiently by maximizing available technological and human resources. As stated in the Proposal, 5,089 investment managers exceed the $100 million filing threshold for Form 13F holding reports. This is approximately 17 times the number of filers that the threshold covered in 1975. STA does not dispute that burdens to the Com mission involving inquiries on Form 13F from small investment managers exist. However, we believe the solution described in the Proposal does not strike a proper balance of satisfying the interests of all market participants. STA believes a more effective solution is a combination of a reporting threshold which is materially lower than the proposed $3.5 billion and additional details from the Commission on the types of inquiries it receives which the industry could opine on with the goal of finding solution s. Rules that Provide Benefits Verses those that Provide Protections STA recognizes that there is a distinction between rules which provide investors a benefit verses rules which provide investors protection. Such situations are usually the result of a rule that once served an investor protection issue, which over time no longer exists due to changes in the regulatory or competitive forces within the marketplace. We believe the current reporting regime involving Form 13F is one such example. Originall y approved in 1975, STA acknowledges the intent of Form 13F is to provide a reporting and disclosure system to benefit the enforcement of orderly markets by the Commission and provide the pubic with information on holdings of institutional investment manag ers who exercise investment discretion over certain accounts of equity securities described in Section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange.5 Another important purpose of the rule is to provide investors and issuers useful information to track “institutional investor holdings in their investments.”6 The Proposal deviates from the value of efficient dissemination of this important information provides by Form 13F. As the Commission has previously stated, “these reports should have the same degree of availability as ot her filings with the Commission.” Investors and the public benefit from information on the investment opinions of large shareholders, including insiders, who by their nature are generally more sophisticated and informed. 5 See Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 13F, Information Required of Institutional Investment Managers Pursuant to Section 13(F) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules Thereunder, available at https://www.sec.gov/pdf/form13f.pdf . 6 Id. page 6 While STA believes that the origin al investor protection elements of Form 13F has diminished over time, we believe that information from Form 13F filings provide meaningful benefits to investors. Costs Associated with Front Running The Proposal states the higher reporting threshold will provide protection from costs associated with other market participants who “engage in behavior that is damaging to the manager and the beneficial owners of the managed portfolio, such as front running (which primarily harms the beneficial owners).” STA views this as overstated. We believe that the existing reporting timeline of 45 days provides adequate protection because it renders the information found in Form 13F useless for facilitating behavior which the Commission describes as “front running.” Future Calculations The Commission seeks input on approaches to adjusting future reporting thresholds. STA recommends the Commission use a consumer price inflation calculation which produces the lowest reporting threshold, which is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (“PCE”) inflation standard through 2018. According to the Proposal that calculation would result in a threshold of $358 million. Recommendation STA recommends that the reporting threshold for Form 13F filings be raised to $375 m illion AUM. This amount represents a rounding up of the PCE inflation standard. According to the Proposal, a $375 million reporting threshold would result in the loss of publicly available shareholder information on roughly 1.9% of all reportable assets, b ut would provide a reporting relief to roughly 2,901, or 57%, of investment managers.7 Conclusion STA appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposal and urges the Commission to consider the need for transparency of holdings for investors when evaluating changing the current Form 13F reporting threshold. The investment process is based on a numb er of variables such as the fundamental valuation of a company, its competitive landscape, management, and price. The information provided in Form 13F is one significant variable that is beneficial in 7 See Reporting Threshold Proposal at 16 and 17. page 7 providing transparency in the investment process and pl ays a critical role in the trading and availability of liquidity in securities, in particular those which are thinly traded securities. STA also wishes to express appreciation to the Commission Staff responsible for drafting the Proposal and providing da ta extremely useful in helping the industry formulate opinions and input.

It has come to our attention that our submission of the 28th included some errors in the summary of the statistics that we cited regarding issuers’ loss of visibility of the identities of their institutional investors that file under Form 13F. These errors have the effect of understat ing the overall loss of visibility for issuers, however the detailed statistics prese nted in our Table 1 remain accurate. We have accordingly included below an amended segment of text from our submission to correct this and have attached a revised complete submission showing the corrected figures. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this and would appreciate the Commission’s consideration of this updated version of our submission. Updated text shown in mark -up: Reduced Transparency from Amended Reporting Threshold We analyzed the application of the amended repo rting threshold across a representative sampling1 of equity issuer and closed end fund clients at varying market capitalizations (Table 1), based on Form 13F filings covering data from the quarter ending June 30, 2020. For equity issuers, the changed thre shold would result, on average, in a loss of visibility of 61% 49.5% of institutional investors that file Form 13F for issuers across the sample set , and a loss of visibility of 9.8% of their shares outstanding , compared to the current threshold. As Table 1 shows, the loss of visibility of shares outstanding is greatest for small and mid -cap issuers, however even the largest issuers would lose visibility of more than 4.5% of their shares outstanding under the revised threshold, compared to their curre nt level of visibility. For issuers with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion, the loss of visibility is 18.2% of shares outstanding . Similarly, closed end fund issuers risk losing visibility of more than 14% of shares outstanding, and 1 To perform this analysis, we divided a sample of 115 equity issuer clients into the five tiers based on market capitalization, identified in Table 1, and quantified the impact of the threshold change for the companies in each tier. Table 1 likewise summar izes our analysis of 32 closed end funds. almost 55% 40% of their total institutional shareholders.

As a p ublic company since 2004 with a $40 billion market cap italization , what our company need s in order to best meet our obligations to our shareholder s is more market transparency —not less. That is why we forcefully oppose the Commission’s proposed amendment to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. Simply put, the current proposal is not the modernization we need ; in fact, it’s the opposite of the reform we’ve been supporting for years . As a large -cap company, w e estimate that the proposed $3.5 billion threshold would allow 59% of our current 13F filers to ev ade disclosure.1 This change, if enacted, would significantly undermine Digital Realty’s understanding of our investors , and how we interact with them . Specifically, it would hinder our existing engagement with shareholder s, which help s to keep us informed as to the issues our share holders care about and enable us to maintain constructive dialogue with those investors and with the broader marketplace . The amendment would also impede our ability to attract new long -term investors2 and d eprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds. These effects would be particularly unwelcome during a period of economic uncertainty when short sell ers and activist hedge funds have the potential to unfairly take advantage of companies with otherwise solid performance track record s and strong fundamentals. 1) We understand that the effects of the proposed amendments would be even more pronounced for small and mid -cap companies. Make no mistake, the impact on large -cap companies will be significant. 2) Under the current rules, we can safely say that any investor that is not required to file under 13F is too small to take on a large long -term position, but if the proposed changes are enacted, we will no longer be able to say that with any confidence. This would put small long -only mutual and hedge fund managers a t a serious disadvantage. John J. Stewart , CFA Senior Vice President Investor Relations Digital Realty Four Embarcadero Center, Suite 3200 San Francisco, CA 94111 USA Tel: +1 415 738 6500 Fax: +1 415 738 6501 www.digitalrealty.com 2 13F data is the only tool available to public companies that shows us which investors are buying or selling shares each quarter . Schedule 13D and 13G reports are not a sufficient alternative because reliance on these reports alone would leave us blind to most ownership changes , given that only four of our shareholders own five percent or more of Digital Realty stock. It would also leave us blind to certain investors who refuse to disclose their stakes —even activists who have raised questions about the company, requested meetings with our management, and/or launched an activist campaign . While it is true that activists falling below the prop osed threshold would be inherently less impactful in terms of their ownership stake, it’s equally true that those activists would have the ability to make noise and manipulate share price behind a veil of secrecy , putting companies at even greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriented fund managers. To be clear, Digital Realty welcomes the views of all shareholders and is not seeking any protections from activist approaches. In fact, quite the contrary – in order to be able to engage with shareholders potentially seeking change, we must be able to kn ow t hat t hey own our shares. Our goal is to communicate with our holders as much as we can, and to be as transparent with them as we can. We know that the SEC, with your mandate to protect investors and ensure good disclosure from public companies, share s this goal, as do advocates of good corporate governance. Rather than raising the threshold and reducing transparency , the reform we need is more robust short sale disclosures and timelier disclosures . Specifically, we urge the Commission to require 13F filers to disclose short and derivative positions, shorten the antiquated 45-day reporting period , and support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure. These reforms would not only fortify public companies’ ability to effectively engage with shareholders, but also give small retail investors visibility when sophisticated investors are actively betting against a stock. These reforms are long overdue , as it’s now been a decade since Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 rightfully called for monthly disclosure of short positions . An example from the not -too-distant past shows the impact that a single investor can have on the market, a nd why real reform is needed to bolster —not diminish —13F disclosures. In 2013, our stock was trading at $69 per share when an activist short seller told investors at a conference t hat Digital Realty was a “melting ice cube” and our shares were only worth $20 per share because our “dividend [was] not sustainable” and our “fundamentals [were] deteriorating.” These comments followed a period when the short seller had been engaging with ou r investor relations team under false pretenses and, unbeknownst to us, accruing a short position. For a time, the comments had a significant downward impact on our share price, which dropped by more than 20% over the next year. John J.

Today —despite the short seller’s grim predictions based on mischaracterizations and inaccurate conclusions —Digital Realty shares are trading at over $140 per share. For the reasons stated above and in light of the concerns expressed by countless individual shareholders and public companies that help fuel our economy , we urge the Commission to withdraw its proposed 13F amendments .

We respectfully submit this letter in opposition to the Proposed Rules. Founded in 1946, the Society is a professional membership association of more than 3,500 corporate and assistant secretaries, in -house counsel, outside counsel, and other governance professionals who serve approximately 1,600 entities, including 1,000 public companies of almost every size and industry. Society members are responsible for supporting the work of corporate boards of directors and the executive managements of their companies on corporate governance and disclosure matters. I. Introduction Congress enacted Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exch ange Act”) , to increase the public availability of information regarding the securities ownership of institutional investors and to increase investor confidence in U.S. securities markets.1 When the final rules relating to the filing and reporting requir ements of institutional investment managers were announced in 1979, the SEC made clear that “[t]he reporting system required by Section 13(f) is intended to create in the Commission a central repository of historical and current data about the investment a ctivities of institutional investment managers, in order to improve the body of factual data available and to facilitate the consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy impl ications of 1 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Office of Audits, Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements , Report No. 480 (September 27, 2010) (the “OIG Review”), at iv. 2 that influence.”2 Accordingly, as the SEC has recognized, the goals of the Section 13(f) disclosure program are to (i) aggregate data in respect of the investment activities of institutional investment managers, (ii) improve public insight into the holdings of institutional investment managers in order to facilitate the assessment of such managers’ impact on the securities markets, and (iii) increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. 3 In signifi cant part because of public companies’ limited visibility to their shareholders ' identities , Form 1 3F filings today make up the primary data input for their “shareholder list s.” These disclosures are a primary source for market participants to understand the ownership profile of an issuer’s securities and, in the view of the Society’s membership, are essential to the functioning, growth, and clarity of the U.S. securities markets . The Proposed Rules would undermine the express purposes of Section 13(f), run contrary to the Commission’s stated objectives with respect to regulating the securities markets, and harm investors, issuers, regulators, and academics alike . In particular , the Pro posed Rules would substantially reduce market visibility into public company holdings —a burden that will be borne by issuers of all sizes4 and that would have the perverse effect of privileging the voices and influence of the already large, growing, and f urther concentrating index funds and larger asset managers at the expense of smaller institutional investors .5 In addition, the Proposed Rule’s massive reduction in 13F data will—in the context of the significant increase in investor activism since Section 13(f) ’s enactment — dramatically reduce confidence in the integrity of U.S. markets. Accordingly, we respectfu lly submit this letter in opposition to the Proposed Rules. Nonetheless, w e support the Commission’s goals of modernizing the information reported on Form 13F and increasing the information provided by institutional investment managers. To that end, in c onnection with a broader overhaul of the shareholder reporting framework, we would be supportive of an increase to the Section 13(f) reporting threshold from $100 million to $450 million to reflect a consumer price inflation adjustment from 1976 to 2019, as previously considered by the Commission and proposed by another commentator .6 However , the Society believes the SEC should only revise the current 13F reporting threshold as part of a comprehensive 2 See Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 15461 (January 5, 1979). 3 OIG Review at iv. 4 As noted in Section II , under the Proposed Rules, issuers with $0 -250 million market capitalization would lose visibility into approximately 38.9% of their shareholder base (while losing visibility into approximately 27.9% of their filers) , while issuers with a market capitaliz ation of $10 billion or greater would lose visibility into approximately 7.4% of their shareholder base (while losing visibility into approximately 55.4% of their filers) . 5 See Julie Segal , The Asset Management Industry Is Getting More Concentrated, Institutional Investor ( October 29, 2018 ), available at https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1bk8n82qcc0kt/The -Asset -Management - Industry- Is-Getting -More -Concentrated ; see also Willis Towers Watson, The world’s largest 500 asset managers – Thinking Ahead Institute and Pensions & Investments joint research (2018), available at https://willistowerswatson.pl/aktualnosci/pdf/2018.10.29- TAI-PI-500_2018.pdf . 6 See Reporting Threshold for I nstitutional Asset Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34 -89290 (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf (“Proposed Rules Release”), at 13, n. 31 . 3 modernization of shareholder reporting. As part of such a comprehensive modernization exercise, the Society reiterates its belief that it would be appropriate for the SEC to shorten the quarterly reporting deadline for 13F filings to two business days after the end of the calendar quarter.7 This letter proceeds as follows. Section II outlines how the Proposed Rules would significant ly reduce market transparency, materially reduce shareholder engagement, hamper capital formation , increase the costs of shareholder activism, and conflict with the policy rationale underlying Section 13(f). Section III provide s a cost -benefit analysi s, demonstrating that any potential cost savings as a result of the Proposed Rules is more than outweighed by the substantial costs resulting from the decline in market transparency . Section IV outlines the Society’s alternative to the modernization of Form 13F reporting regime , proposing to increase the existing threshold to $450 million and reducing the reporting period to two business days , as part of a comprehensive m odernization of Section 13 shareholder reporting. II. Loss of Transparency In 1971, the SEC released the Institutional Investor Study Report that was commissioned by Congress three years prior (the “Institutional Investor Report”).8 There, the Commission recognized that “[t]he importance of a regularized, uniform and comprehensive, scheme of institutional reporting cannot be minimized in light of the demonstrated growth of institutional investment and its impacts on the structure of securities markets, corporate issuers and individual investors.”9 Accordingly, the SEC concluded in the Institutional Investor Report that “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors should be eliminated” and recommended that the Commission be granted the “general authority to require reports and disclosures of such holdings and transactions from all types of institutional investors.” 10 As currently contemplated , the Proposed Rules w ould eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers , 7 See NYSE Euronext, Socie ty of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals, and National Investor Relations Institute, Letter to Ms. Elizabeth M. Murphy, Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (February 1, 2013). 8 See Institutional Investor Study Report, H.R. Doc. No. 92 -64 (1971). 9 See Institutional Investor Study Report, H.R. Doc. No. 92 -64, at X (1971). 10 See Institutional Investor Study Report, H.R. Doc. No. 92 -64, at X (1971). 4 representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets.11 This means that nearly 90% of institutional investment managers would be r elieved from reporting on Form 13F . In other words, i ncreasing the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion and eliminating the Form 13F filing requirement for nearly 90% of filers12 widens —not closes —the very same gaps that the SEC was concerned with in the 1 970s . Accordingly, t he Society expects that the Proposed Rules would materially reduce the ability of issuers to satisfy investors’ increasing demand for engagement and would complicate the ability of all issuers (but particularly smaller issuers) to access working capital . Implementation of the Proposed Rules would also eliminate disclosure by the vast majority of activist investors of positions below 5% , potentially resulting in an increase in stealth shareholder activist activity and value destruction for both issuers and activist investors. A. Market Change Has Reduced Transparency Under Existing 13F Regime In 1978, when Form 13F was adopted, the distribution of market capitalizations among public companies was more uniform than it is today. In the current market , valuations are markedly more concentrated , with the top five publicly traded U.S. companies constitut ing approximately 23.1% of the S&P 500.13 The shareholder bases of larger issuers are also typically dominated by larger investors that accumulate sizable position s in such issuers. In 2020, the “big three” index funds, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, controlled approximately 20% of the S&P 500,14 representing a radical departure from the historically dispersed ownership of the U.S. stock market.15 11 See Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020- 07-10. 12 See Press Release, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC Proposes Amendments to Update Form 13F for Institutional Investment Managers; Amend Reporting Threshold to Reflect Today’s Equities Markets (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152. 13 These companies are: Apple Inc. (~ 6.5%), Amazon.com, Inc. (~5. 3%), Microsoft Corporation (~5. 2%) Alphabet Inc. (~3.5%) and Facebook, Inc. (~2.6%), as of September 12, 2020. 14 See Lucian A. Bebchuk & Scott Hirst, The Specter of the Giant Three , 99 B.U. L. Rev. 721, 724 (2019). 15 See Caleb N. Griffin, We Three Kings: Disintermediating Voting at the Index Fund Giants , 79 MD. L. REV. 954, 960 (2020), available at https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/mlr/vol79/iss4/3 . 5 As demonstrated in Table 1 below,16 market changes over the past 42 years have led to an outdated disclosure regime under Section 13(f) . For example, smaller issuers with market capitalizations of up to $250 million have relatively poor visibility into their shareholder base under the exist ing 13(f) regime: only 36.7% of their shares outstanding (on average)17 are reported on Form 13F . On the other hand, mid -and large -capitalization issuers have greater visibility today: over 80% of their shares outstanding (on average) are reported on Form 13F. Table 1 (Source: Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 18, 2020) B. Impact of the Proposed Rules Under the Proposed Rules, the gap in visibility into the shareholder bases of large - versus small- capitalization issuers is likely to widen substantially . As demonstrated in Table 2 below, issuers with market capitalization s below $250 million would lose visibility in to approximately 38.9% of their shares outstanding (on average) , while issuers with market capitalization s of $10 billion or greater would lose visibility into approximately 7.4% of their shares outstanding (on average) . The Society is also aware of members representing larger issuers who expect substantially greater reduction s in transparency with r espect to their shares outstanding than the average reported in the S urvey. 16 For data presented, or otherwise referred to, in the letter in Tables 1 through 4 and 6 through 7, please see Exhibit A for Innisfree’s meth odology. 17 In this letter, “ on average ” means that with respect to each of the seven ranges of market capitalizations described in Tables 1 through 4 and 6 through 7 , the median 30 stocks were taken as a sample group. 6 Table 2 (Source: Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 18, 2020) The Proposed Rules would also have a differential effect on issuers by market capitalization with respect to each issuer’s visibility in the number of filers of Form 13Fs holding its stock . As demonstrated in Table 3 below, issuers with market capitalization s of $10 billion or greater would lose visibility into approximately 55 .4% of their filers (on average) , while issuers with market capitalization s below $250 million would lose visibility into approximately 27.9% of their filers (on average) . In other words , although smaller issuers would lose visibility into substantially more shares than larger issuers under the Proposed Rules , the larger issuers are expected to lose visibility into substantially more filers than smaller issuers. The Society expects the i mpact of these changes to significantly affect the ability of issuers across all market capitalizations to identify and engage with their shareholders . Even if those smaller investors who will no longer be visible to issuers only hold a small percentage o f an issuer’s shares outstanding, such investors may still have a significant influence on issuers (e.g., hedge funds and activists) . Moreover , the net effect of privileging the voices of larger investors over smaller investors is antithetical to the Commission’s mission and to the preferences of issuer and the invest ment community. Table 3 (Source: Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 18, 2020) As discussed in Section IV, the Society believes that increasing the existing threshold to $450 million would have a les s harmful effect on issuers across all market capitalizations , while 7 still advancing the Commission’s goals of modernizing the informati on reported on Form 13F and increasing the information provided by institutional investment managers . C. Impact of the Proposed Rules on Shareholder Engagement As Chairman Clayton has noted, “[s]hareholder engagement is a hallmark of our public capital markets”18 and one of the “key principles” of our securities laws.19 Further to such suggestions, the Commission has, in recent years, taken steps to enhance shareholder engagement in the corporate governance of public companies and attempted to modernize SEC rules around such engagement. 20 The Society fears that the Proposed Rules would lead to a stark regression in shareholder engagement. Since the adoption of Section 13(f) more than 40 years ago, there has been a meaningful increase in shareholder engagement by issuers , including engagement with respect to long- term strategy, M&A, environmental, social, corporate governance and other matters, establishing a foundation for communications with shareholders and increasing shareholder confidence.21 To that end, issuers commonly hire and retain investor relations profess ionals to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard, conveyed to management, and acted on.22 According to a survey of 15 7 issuers conducted by the Society in September 2020 (the “Survey”),23 approximately 94% of the respondents stated they use Form 13F to identify institutional ownership, approximately 89% of the respondents stated they use Form 13F to monitor accumulations of holdings , and approximately 68% of the respondents stated they use 18 Chairman Jay Clayton, Statement Announcing SEC Staff Roundtable on the Proxy Process (July 30, 2018), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/statement- announcing -sec-staff-roundtable -proxy- process 19 Chairman Jay Clayton, Statement at Open Meeting on Proposals to Enhance the Accuracy, Transparency and Effectiveness of Our Proxy Voting System (Nov. 5, 2019), available at https://w ww.sec.gov/news/public - statement/statement- clayton -2019- 11-05-open -meeting (“Today’s proposals are both rooted in key principles of our securities law. First, materiality. The proposals are designed to ensure investors receive the material information th at would be expected to affect their investment decisions (including voting decisions). Second, facilitating constructive, information -rich engagement among shareholders and issuers in a manner that benefits all shareholders and our public capital markets more generally .”) 20 See, e.g. , U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “What We Are Doing to Enhance Shareholder Engagement,” available at https://www.sec.gov/what- we-are-doing -improve -shareholder -engagement . 21 Recently, issuers addressed investors’ concerns about COVID -19’s impact on their business and industry, including the pandemic’s effect on revenue generation, profitability, and over all financial health. 22 See Joint Comment Letter, National Investor Relations Institute , Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34- 89290; File No. S7- 08-20, available at https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI_13F_Joint_Issuer_Letter_SEC_2.docx (“NIRI Letter”) 23 The Survey conducted by the Society reflects responses from 157 issuers, of which 75 (~48%) are issuers with market capitalization of $10 billion or m ore, 50 issuers (~32%) are issuers with market capitalization between $2-$10 billion, 25 (~16%) are issuers with market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion, and 7 (~4%) are issuers with market capitalization of less than $300 million . The Su rvey is attached as Exhibit B. 8 Form 13F to identify, prepare and respond to activist attack s. In response to the Survey’s question regarding how the issuer monitors investor movements in the issuer’s stock, approximately 14% of the respondents stated they use Form 13F reports, approximately 10% of the respondents stated that they use either a stock surveillance program or a stock watch firm (who in turn use Form 13F reports ), and approximately 75% of the respondents stated they use a combination of Form 13F reports and stock watch. In the absence of comprehensive Form 13F data, the mem bers of the Society fear that they would be left without an adequate source to track their shareholders, especially if they may not be able to afford costly stock surveillance programs to assist in the verification of investor ownership. Even if they could afford stock surve illance programs , or are currently using such programs , all stock surveillance programs rely on the disclosures provided on Form 13F to form the initial basis of their analysis . Accordingly, the Proposed Rules would render stock survei llance services substantially less effective . Further, t he inability of issuers to identify their investors by relying on the quarterly ownership information set forth in Form 13F filings is particularly problematic in light of misrepresentation by invest ors of their positions in issuers. 24 According to the Survey, approximately 15% of the respondent s stated they have experienced misrepresentation by investors of their holdings while seeking engagement with issuers’ management or board of directors. As general counsel, corporate secretaries, and other governance professionals, the Society’s members are frequently tasked with managing their company’s shareholder meeting processes, including facilitating the exercise of shareholder voting rights, and spearheading shareholder engagement efforts. According to the Survey, approximately 86% of the respondents stated that they are using Form 13F reports in formulati ng their shareholder engagement strategy and meeting s, and virtually all ( 98%) of the respondents stated that the Proposed Rules do not facilitate shareholder engagement . Moreover, given the l oss of visibility into the shareholder base s of issuers across a ll market capitalizations , compliance, monitoring and shareholder engagement costs are likely to increase substantially . 25 The Proposed Rules would make effective and efficient interactions between issuers and investors much more difficult. As detailed above , increasing the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion would reduce issuers’ insight into their investor base, making it more difficult to discern the appropriate amount of time and resources necessary for direct engagement with shareholders that have requested to speak with management and/or board of directors . According to the Survey, approximately 67% of the respondents stated that they believe the Proposed Rules would result in a decrease in engagement with investors with less than $3.5 billion asset s under management . Additionally, such limited insight would potentia lly make it more difficult for issuers’ boards of directors to ascertain to whom (and to what type of investors) they owe their fiduciary duties. Further, a nother likely result of the reduced insight is that large institutional investors ( i.e., those that will continue to provide 24 See NIRI Letter. (“Unfortunately, companies cannot simply accept investors’ representations at face value. In a 2016 survey of NIRI members , 45 percent said they definitely had experiences with investors who misrepresented their positions to obtain meetings with C -suite executives, while another 31 percent said they suspected that had happened”). 25 According to the Survey, approximately 67 percent of the respondents stated they anticipate incurring costs (financial or otherwise) as a result of loss of visibility into their shareholder base. 9 Form 13F disclosure) will be further prioritized and therefore exert even greater influence over issuers at the expense of smaller investors, a result both contrary to the Commission’s efforts to improve participation in corporate processes by smaller investors26 and detrimental to the securities markets as a whole.27 D. Negative Impact on Capital Formation As issuers and academics have noted, the Proposed Rules’ attempt at preventing front running and copycatting com es at the cost of significant “market opacity,” which, in turn, results in a reduction in capital formation.28 On the one hand, Form 13F data is essential to the ability of issuers to identify potential investors and attract new long- term investments neces sary for growth. The opaqueness of an issuer’s investor base will likely cloud fundraising activities, as certain issuers will suffer from an inability to pinpoint new capital sources ( e.g., investors that have made investments in the issuer’s industry) a nd monitor the efficacy of certain interactions with prospective shareholders. This is especially true for newly public issuers who may regularly access the securities market . Such issuers rely on information from Form 13F to monitor their shareholder base and engage with potential investors on an ongoing basis. This engagement is critical, as equity offerings are typically conducted with only one or two days of public marketing. With the adoption of Rule 163B, which allows “testing- the-waters” for all issuers, the SEC has validated the need for such engagement. On the other hand, the visibility provided by Form 13F disclosures encourages investments from smaller investors ( i.e., through the assessment of crowdedness of 26 See Chairman Jay Clayton, Remarks at the PLI 49th Annual Institute on Securities Regulation (Nov. 8, 2017), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech -clayton -2017- 11-08 (“I have become increasingly concerned that the voices of long- term retail investors may be underrepresented or selectively represented in corporate governance. For instance, the SEC staff estimates that over 66% of the Russell 1000 companies are owned by Main Street investors, either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, pension or other employer - sponsored funds, or accounts with investment advisers. And, if foreign ownership is excluded, that percentage approaches approximately 79%. Yet it is not clear whether in our rulemaking processes the views and fundamental interests of long- term retail investors are being advocated fully and clearly, either by indi vidual investors or groups that represent them. ”); U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “What We Are Doing to Enhance Shareholder Engagement,” available at https://www.sec.gov/what- we-are-doing- improve -shareholder - engagement . 27 The SEC has indicated that the Proposed Rules flow, in part, from its view that “the relative significance of managing $100 million in securities as compared with the overall size of the U.S. equities market has declined considerably.” Reporting Threshold for Institutional Asset Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34- 89290 (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34- 89290.pdf (“Proposed Rules Release”). W hile the relative significance of managing $100 million in securities may have declined from a financial perspective, the relative significance of managing $100 million in securities has increased from a corporate governance and shareholder engagement perspective. Indee d, smaller managers play a critical economic role in the securities markets, driving price discovery in a manner that their larger counterparts typically do not . See The Vanguard Group, Inc., A drop in the bucket: Indexing’s share of U.S. trading activity , at 7, available at https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/ISGINDX.pdf (2019) (estimating that indexing represents less than 5% of overall U.S. trading volume). 28 See, e.g., Prof. Dan Bernhardt and Dr. Guillem Ordonez -Calafi , Letter to Vanes sa A. Countryman (August 6, 2020); Heather Kos, Univar Solutions, Letter to Vanes sa A. Countryman (August 7, 2020). 10 trades).29 The Proposed Rules, and the attendant loss of visibility, introduce uncertainty for investors, potentially yielding fewer investments that facilitate capital f ormation and growth for issuers and making the securities offering process disproportionately burdensome for all issuer s. E. Promotion of Activist Activity Increasing the ownership threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion would result in many of the most influential activist hedge funds no longer filing Form 13F reports altogether.30 In the wake of the Proposed Rules, out of a total of 123 activist hedge funds that are currently required to file, only 25 (20%) would continue reporting on Form 13F.31 That is , other than the largest activists ( e.g., Carl Icahn, Elliott Management, and Third Point), even prolific and vocal activists, such as Starboard Value, JANA Partners, Greenlight Capital, Engaged Capital, Land and Buildings, and Marcato, would generally not be required to disclose their sub-5% positions on a quarterl y basis on Form 13F . Eliminating Form 13F disclosure for most activist investors will affect issuers across all market capitalizations but will have an especially significant impact on smaller issuers, which are already more vulnerable to activism and hostile takeover activity than their larger peers.32 As shown in Table 4 below, under the current $100 million reporting threshold, a ctivists hold a combined value of $64.2 billion worth of stock in small- capitalization issuers. As a result of the Proposed Rules , activists will continue reporting only $32.6 billion worth of stock in small- capitalization issuers. In other words, roughly 50% of activist equity holdings ($31.6 billion worth of stock) in smaller issuers would “ go dark ”. To compare, as a result of the Proposed Rules, mid -and large -capitalizations issuers would lose visibility of 28% and 12%, respectively, of activists’ positions . 29 See Joanna Ossinger , Goldman Warns SEC Proposal Could Shroud Hedge -Fund Crowding, Bloomberg (July 20, 2020) (““ The primary drawback of fewer hedge fund filings is lack of clarity around crowding risk,” strategists led by David Kostin said in a note July 17. “Reported hedge fund holdings allow investors to understand crowding risk, and to appropriately hedge portfolios. ””) 30 See Eduardo Gallardo, Why the SEC’s Proposal to Amend Rule 13f -1 Should Fail, The CLS Blue Sky Blog (July 27, 2020), available at https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2020/07/27/why -the-secs-proposal -to-amend - rule-13f-1-should- fail/. 31 Based on data extracted from S&P Capital IQ, as of August 21, 2020. See Exhibit A for Innisfree’s methodology. 32 See Table 5, showing proxy fights against U.S. issuers (across market capitalizations) in 2016 through 2020 (YTD) . As demonstrated in Table 5 , ~85 percent of the proxy fights launched between 2016 and 2020 (YTD), were against small -capitalization issuers . 11 Table 4 ( Source : Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 30, 2020) As a result of reduced disclosure by activist investors , issuers will no longer have key existing tools to identify, monitor , and prepare themselves for activist campaigns that frequently seek to influence the management, control, and boards of directors of issuers . In recent years, shareholder activists have become more numerous and diverse than they were in the past, both in their agendas and their methods . While in the 1980s corporate control and takeovers were activists’ primary goals, t oday’s shareho lder activism is more focused on attempting to manufactur e short - term value without a change in control, and doing so by leveraging a small ownership percentage , often no more than three to five percent. These changes in activism trends have led issuers’ boards of directors , together with management , to engage with shareholder activists proactively .33 The Proposed Rules will inhibit the ability of issuers, particularly smaller issuers , to effectively prepare for, identify, and respond to activist attack s, potentially facilitating the short -term investment objectives of a small subset of investors at the expense of the broader shareholder base . Additionally, the inability to identify activist investors is likely to increase the cost of shareholder activi sm activity for both issuers and investors while simultaneously reducing trust and transparency between them. Activists and issuers frequently reach settlements on the basis of an implicit understanding of how s hareholders are likely to vote on a given issue , thereby negating the necessity of prolonged and expensive shareholder solicitation processes . Table 5 below show s the total number of proxy fights against U.S. issuers (across market capitalizations) between the years 2016 and 2020 (YTD) and the percentage of reported settlements reached in each of these 33 See Chris Ruggeri , Deloitte Transactions and Business Analytics LLP , Investor Engagement and Activist Shareholder Strategies , Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance (February 19, 2019), available at https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/02/19/investor -engagement -and-activist- shareholder -strategies/ . 12 years out of the total number of proxy fights . On average, the percentage of settlements across all issuer market capitalizations was approximately 32 percent between the years 2016 and 2020 (YTD) , with a higher percentage of settlements occurring at small- and mid- capitalization issuers. The Proposed Rules would make settlements and other informal, non- public discussions (such as “quiet” campaigns where an activist engages with the issuer behind the scenes) with activists significantly more challenging because it would be more difficult to gauge investor sentiment, predict shareholder voting outcomes, and quantify the value of preempting proxy contests . Table 5 (Sour ce: FactSet , as of September 13, 2020) III. The SEC’s Cost Benefit Analysis is Incomplete and Warrants Reconsideration A. Purported Savings Do Not Justify The Reduction In Transparency We believe that the Commission’s economic analysis related to these proposed amendments requires further study by the Commission of the cost and ben efit impact s on market participants, including public company issuers represented by the Society. Particularly, w hile we believe there are opportunities to improve the timeliness and transparency of this data, further economic analysis by the Commission of the substantial costs of the lost transparency of 13F data on public company issuers is needed34, as the 13F filings remain the only publicly- available source for public companies for quarterly data on the “street name” investors who are buying or selling their shares. As mentioned above, the Society’s members heavily rely on 13F data to make determinations regarding capital formation activities and shareholder engagement strategies, including increasing their understanding as to whether shareholders are invested in them for the long- term. While the Commission’s econom ic analysis stresses the availability of other data sources, such as the S chedules 13D and 13G, and the Form N -PORT , these reports are not adequate substitutes , as Schedules 13D and 13G only become applicable if a person acquires beneficial ownership of 5 percent or more of an issuer’s outstanding shares . Likewise, Form N -PORT data 34 See Com missioner Allison Herren Lee, “ Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting” (July 10, 2020)(noting the limitations on the cost and benefit analysis on lost transparency as well as the limitations of assessing the reduced burdens to inve stment managers). 13 is only publicly available on a delayed basis and is limited to registered management investment companies, which are more likely to be the large st firms , which would continue to be identified through 13F filings and Schedules 13D and 13G. Therefore, w ithout the 13F reports, Society members would be limited in track ing ownership changes or verifying how much of their respective stock is owned by investors who may refuse to disclose their stakes – even after those investor reach out to issuers, request meetings with issuer management, or launch activist campaigns against issuers . However, the Commission’s proposal does not provide a more specific analysis of the value of this lost transparency. Without access to 13F data, the Society’s members, as discussed above, would need to further rely on stock surveillance firms for capital formation activities and shareholder engagement. In 2016, Bloomberg estimated the annual cost of stock surveillance was $25,000 to $50,000 35 and in the experience of the Society’s members these annual costs are currently far higher and potentially prohibitive for smaller issuers .36 With the competitive force of freely available 13F data removed, stock surveillance firms would likely be able to charge more for their services (even as the services would become less effective due to the absence of this 13F data) and become more cost prohibitive for smaller issuers. In addition, the Soc iety believes further study by the Commission is required on the cost consequences to issuers and shareholders on capital formation activities and reduced and less effective shareholder engagement. As discussed above, less engagement would ultimately lead to more proxy contests and less effective engagement processes with respect to activists’ campaigns and shareholders generally. A ctivist campaign s are costly for management, both in direct expenses and in the significant time and attention diverted from running the business. The Society believes ongoing shareholder engagement and bringing activists shareholders and issuers together to the negotiating table sooner allows public company issuers to achieve better outcomes for shareholders overall, including through negotiated settlements and costs avoided. 37 The data provided by 13F filings is a key tool for issuers to continue positive engagement strategies that allow them the opportunity to proactively avoid these costs and achieve negotiated outcomes that benefit its shareholders at large. 35 “Do IROs Need Shareholder Surveillance Services?” Bloomberg Professional (August 15, 2015) https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/do- iros-need -shareholder -surveillance -services . 36 See National Investor Relations Institute, The Case for 13F Reform at 1 (Sept. 25, 2019), https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019- final.pdf . 37 Cyriac, Joseph; De Backer , Ruth. “Preparing for bi gger, bolder shareholder activists” ( McKinsey & Company 2014) (finding collaborative, negotiated, or settled response to activist initiatives tends to lead to higher excess shareholder returns than a combative one s); See also Ide, Michael. “Proxy Fights Cost Companies $4.8 Million on Average” (September 2014). 14 The expenses of responding to activists’ campaigns are substantial to the Society members and ultimately are passed through to shareholders. A 2014 study found that a contested activist campaign costs a company between $10 million and $20 million – plus weeks of management time to develop plans and meet with investors.38 Furthermore, Society members are more frequently being asked for reimbursements of expenses from activists’ campaigns with U.S. public company issuers spending an average $431,831 to cover activists’ campaigning costs in 2018.39 Without 13F data, the Society would expect that these costs would grow significantly as public company issuers would have less information to create proactive engagement s trategies that can avoid distracting protracted activist campaigns and proxy contests and would experience substantially increased costs in identifying investors through such campaigns. Analysis on the potential increase in these costs, which are already substantial for public company issuers 40, along with the negative impact on capital formation, is absent from the Commission’s current analysis and merits further consideration. IV. 13F Changes To Be Considered As Part of a Comprehensive Modernization of Shar eholder Reporting The Society welcomes the SEC’s efforts to modernize the reporting regime applicable to institutional investment managers but does not believe modernization can be accomplished in a piecemeal fashion. The Society believes that efforts to modernize the Form 13F reporting regime should only be made in a holistic manner as part of a comprehensive modernization of shareholder reporting.41 Such a holistic approach would updat e the regime to provide for more current information, reflec t the reality of modern investment practices so that reports do not present a distorted and inaccurate view of investment activities and, because those reforms could impose some incremental costs on institutio nal investment managers, the Society would support an increas e in the threshold for Form 13F reporting to $450 million to reduce burdens on smaller managers. A. New $450 million Threshold The Society appreciates that the reporting threshold for Section 13(f) has not been increased since it was first implemented and that the reforms discussed below would impose some incremental costs on some institutional investment managers. As a result, if the SEC is amenable to modernizing Form 13F holisticall y, the Society would be supportive of a modest increase in the 13F reporting threshold.

As an alternative to such a dramatic increase in the reporting threshold and associated reduction in information made available to the public, issuers, and the SEC, the Society believes that an increase of the threshold to $450 million, reflecting inflation,42 would have a les s harmful effect on issuers across all market capitalizations . As demonstrated in Table 6 below, under the proposed $450 million threshold, issuers with market capitalization s below $250 million would lose visibility into approximately 15.4% of their shares outstanding ( on average) (versus a loss of approximately 38.9% under the Proposed Rules)43, while issuers with market capitalization s of $10 billion or greater would lose visibility into approximately 1.4% of their share s outstanding ( on average) (versus a loss of approximately 7.4% under the Proposed Rules) .44 Additionally, as demonstrated in Table 7 below, under the proposed $450 million threshold, issuers with market capitalization s of $10 billion or greater would lose visibility into approximately 20.8% of their filers (on average ) (versus a loss of approximately 55.4% under the Proposed Rules)45 and issuers with market capitalization s below $250 million would lose visibility into approximately 5.7% of their filers (on average ) (versus a loss of approximately 27.9% under the Proposed Rules) .46 42 See Proposing Release at 15. 43 See Table 2 . 44 See Table 2 . 45 See Table 3 . 46 See Table 3 . 16 Table 6 (Source: Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 18, 2020) Table 7 (Source: Innisfree M&A Incorporated, as of August 18, 2020) Further , under the proposed $450 million threshold, issuers across all market capitalizations would lose visibility into approximately 7.5% of their share s outstanding (on average) (versus a loss of approximately 22.3% under the Proposed Rules) .47 Additionally, issuers across all market capitalizations would lose visibility into approximately 10.5% of their filers (on average) (versus a loss of approximately 36% under the Proposed Rules) .48 To that end, the Society believes that a proportional increase of the existing threshold to $450 million would have a les s harmful effect on issuers across all market capitalizations by allowing them to maintain greater visibility into their shareholder base s as well as to identify their investors , while still advancing the Commission’s goals of modernizing the information reported on Form 13F and 47 See Table s 2 and 6 . 48 See Table s 3 and 7 and note 18. 17 increasing the information provided by institutional investment managers .49 This approach would be consistent with the recommendation of the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (the “ OIG”).50 B. Reduce Reporting Period to Two Business Days The Society believes reducing the significant lag between the date triggering Form 13F disclosure and the filing date would provide substantial benefits to issuers and the market as a whole, while imposing only limited additional costs on institutional investment managers. Currently, the Form 13F reporting regime can allow for over a year —up to 382 days —between when an institutional investment manager first becomes subject to the requirement to file Form 13F and when that manager’s first filing is due.51 That first report would include information as of the end of the fourth calendar quarter of the year during which the institutional investment manager crosses the filing threshold and be filed 45 days after that quarter end. Subsequent reports are due 4 5 days after the end of each calendar quarter and present information as of the end of that calendar quarter. The six -and-a-half weeks between quarter end, the time as of which a Form 13F presents information, and the date a Form 13F is required to be filed has long been the subject of criticism. In 2013, the Society, together with NYSE Euronext and the National Investor Relations Institute, petitioned the SEC to reduce the reporting deadline to two business days after the end of the calendar quarter. 52 The Society continues to believe that a shorter reporting cycle is appropriate. As noted in its 2013 petition, the month- and-a-half-long gap between the date of the information and when it is published inhibits the ability of issuers to identify, communicate with and engage with their shareholders in real time and results in outdated information being provided to the market and the SEC. The Soci ety believes that institutional investment managers track their portfolios on a daily, if not more frequent, basis , and would be able to produce the limited information – consisting primarily of a list of holdings and their value – required by Section 13(f), within two business days of a reporting date without undue hardship, 53 especially because the date 49 In supporting that proposal, the Society notes that compliance costs for Form 13F have not increased in over time. In 1979, the SEC reported that the average compliance cost per Form 13F was approximately $3,000 – or $12,000 annually. SEC Release No. 34 -15461 (January 5, 1979). Adjusted for inflation, that would equal approximately $40,000 o f annual costs today. In the Proposing Release, the SEC estimates annual compliance costs for Form 13F of between $15,000 and $30,000. 50 See Office of the Inspector General, Review of the SEC’s 13(f) Reporting Requirements (Sept. 27, 2010) at pp . 26 – 27, available at https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oig/reports/audits/2010/480.pdf (“OIG Report”). 51 Investors are required to test if they have crossed the 13(f) threshold on the last trading day of each month. An investor that first crossed the 13(f) threshold on January 31, 2020 would not be required to file their first Form 13F until February 16, 2021 (February 14, 2021 being a Sunday and February 15, 2021 being a holiday). See Securities and Exchange Commission, Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F, Question 25, available at: https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm . 52 See Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Feb. 1, 2013), available at https://www. sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4- 659.pdf . 53 Other mandated filings, including those that may be triggered by events rather than a set calendar date, have far shorter reporting deadlines. For example, a Form 4 is required to be filed within 2 busines s days of a trade that 18 as of which the information need be presented and the date on which it would be required to be filed would be set by regulation and known in advance. Similarly, current technology allow s the period of time between when an institutional investment manager becomes subject to reporting under Section 13(f) and the first reporting deadline to be substantially shortened. While the Society acknowledges that the filing of an initial Form 13F may require more effort than subsequent filings, we believe it is appropriate to requir e an institutional investment manager to file a Form 13F with information as of the end of quarter subsequent to the quarter during whi ch that manager crosses the Section 13(f) threshold ( e.g., if a manager crosses the threshold on January 2, its first filing would include information as of June 30 and be filed in early July) and that such period should provide adequate time to prepare that filing. In 1979, the SEC focused on the following benefit to justify changing Form 13F filing obligations from annual to quarterly: “Both corporations and financial reporting services asserted that quarterly reporting is needed to provide corporate t reasurers with current information concerning institutions owning their stock. They pointed out that many stockholders take ownership in nominee or street name, making it difficult to trace such information and making it difficult to secure proxies on important corporate matters.” 54 That remains at least as relevant – if not more relevant – today as it was in 1979 given the massive increase in beneficial ownership of equity securities . In addition, since 1979, the frequency and depth of engagement be tween issuers and their respective shareholders has expanded dramatically. However, the fact that Form 13F reports contain only outdated information substantially reduces the ability of issuers and market participants to actually engage with shareholders i n real time with the benefit of that information . Although a long period between the end of a quarter and when information was required to be filed under Form 13F may have been necessary to accommodate systems used by institutional investment managers in 1979, technological advancements have made it so that is no longer the case, nor is it consistent with shareholders’ expectations regarding issuer engagement. The Society acknowledges that a shortened reporting cycle may lead to calls from hedge funds re garding greater copycatting and front running, and the frequency of confidential treatment requests. As noted in the Society’s 2013 rulemaking petition, these concerns are unpersuasive and rest on the argument that “the 45- day delay period works to the advantage of Managers at the cost of other investors.” 55 We would add that for first -time 13F filers , the “delay period” is frequently far longer. To the extent there are specific positions for which institutional investment managers have particular concer ns, those can be addressed through the Commission’s process for handling confidential treatment requests. In connection with a potential increase in confidential treatment triggers a Form 4 reporting obligation and a Current Report on Form 8- K is generally required to be filed within four business days of a triggering event. 54 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5, 1979) [44 FR 3033]. 55 See Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Feb. 1, 2013), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf . 19 requests, the Society would encourage the Commission and its staff (“ Staff ”) to ado pt guidelines to the effect that the Staff will review, approve, reject or comment on confidential treatment requests within 30 days of receipt. C. The scope of Form 13F reporting should be enhanced to avoid reporting of incomplete and potentially misleading information The Society agrees with the finding of the OIG that “[t]he current Form 13F does not provide for the disclosure of all significant investment activities of institutional investment managers, and it could be improved to be more useful to the public.” 56 The 13F reporting regime presents an incomplete p icture of both long positions in 13F securities held by institutional investment managers and the overall economic exposure of those managers to 13F securities. Currently, Form 13F generally does not address reporting of derivative positions other than listed options. As a result, the treatment of positions that are economically equivalent to purchases of 13F securities remains unclear. The limited guidance that is available sheds little light on that matter. For example, in a letter issued to the New Yo rk State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Staff made clear that institutional investment managers that lend securities should report those securities on Form 13F – even though the borrower (and not the lender) holds title to those securities during the ter m of the loan. 57 The Staff reasoned that: “[t]he Reporting Manager still has investment discretion over the loaned securities because he has the authority to sell the loaned securities, even though such transactions typically may not be consummated unti l the conclusion of the loan. In addition, the non-reporting of the loaned securities could render the data base created by Form 13F filings incomplete and therefore unsuitable for analyses of trading activities of Reporting Managers…. If Reporting Managers do not report loaned securities, it would be difficult to analyze the data of different reporting periods of a given Reporting Manager because no one will be able to determine whether the difference in holdings is caused by the lending of securities or the purchase or sale of securities. Thus, for example, one could improperly infer greater trading activity by a Reporting Manager when in actuality the Manager only lent securities. … Finally, if institutional investment managers are not required to report loaned securities, they could avoid the reporting requirements of Rule 13f -1 by lending enough securities on the last trading day of each month to bring the total amount of investments they manage under $100 million.” However, other transactions that r esult in an institutional investment manager having economic exposure to a 13F security without directly holding that security are not addressed. For example, an institution that holds the long position in a physically- settled total return swap that references a 13F security is in an economic position similar to that of a securities lender – it remains economically exposed to the security, has a right to obtain the security at maturity of the transaction and does not currently have title to the security. If an institutional investment manager was not required to report the position held through that total return swap, on maturity of the total return swap, it would report an increase in its position in the relevant 13F security even though it may 56 OIG Report at p . 25. 57 See SEC No -Action Letter, New York State Teachers’ Retirement System (avail. Nov. 16, 1990). 20 have acqui red economic exposure to that position in a prior period – giving an inaccurate view of its trading activities. Similarly, it could use total return swaps or similar instruments to avoid 13F reporting requirements. The Society believes that the SEC sho uld clarify the treatment of derivative securities under Section 13(f), making clear that positions that are substantially equivalent economically to direct ownership of a 13F security should be reported. Equally importantly, the Society believes that the SEC should generally provide detailed guidance as to the treatment of derivative securities under the 13F reporting regime to ensure that all market participants are reporting on a like basis and that reports can be accurately interpreted. 58 Additionally , the current 13F reporting regime does not present a full picture of the trading activities of institutional investment managers because it does not require disclosure of short positions .59 Reporting of short positions would provide substantial value to issuers by allowing them to better identify holders that have a significant economic position in the company – facilitating their ability to identify persons with whom the issuers should comm unicate and engage. The Society believes that institutional investment managers often utilize short positions as part of their investment strategy, both for hedging and speculative purposes. It is difficult to see how Form 13F can serve its primary goals – “[f]irst, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment manage rs and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securi ties markets” 60 – while requiring reporting that distorts the economic position and trading activities by institutional investment managers by excluding short positions. The Society believes that institutional investment managers track their short positions on a daily basis, if not more frequently, and that the incremental burden of including those positions on a Form 13F together with long positions would be minimal. To the extent that specific short positions give rise to material concerns regarding front running or copycatting, those concerns are better addressed through the SEC’s process for confidential treatment requests than a blanket exclusion of those positions fr om public reporting. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this proposal. We would be happy to provide you with further information to the extent you would find it useful. 58 In addition to clarifying the treatment of derivatives, the Society believes that the SEC should harmonize the definition of “investment discretion” in Section 3(a)(35) of the Exchange Act and the definition of “ beneficial owner ” in Exchange Act Rule 13d- 3 or, in the alternative, provide further guidance as to the interpretation of “investment discretion” and the differences between that “investment discretion” and “beneficial owner”. 59 See Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Sec urities Exchange Act of 1934 (October 7, 2015) , available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf . 60 See Proposing Release at text accompanying n. 20. 21 Respectfully submitted, James G.

Scope . The data used for the analysis presented is based on stocks of publicly traded U.S. companies. Any listing that is not shares of common stock (or is more than one type of common stock) was removed from the dataset ( e.g., dual class sh ares and American depositary receipts). 2. Categorizing. The data was then broken into seven ranges based on the market capitalization of the underlying company for the stock. The seven market capitalization ranges are: $10 billion or more, $5 to $10 billion, $3.5 to $5 billion, $1.5 to $3.5 billion, $500 million to $1.5 billion, $250 to $500 million, and less than $250 million. 3. Sampling. Within each range, the median 30 stocks were taken as a sample group. The 30 stocks per range across the seven ranges t otaled 210 sample stocks that were used for this analysis. 4. Analytics . The complete list of public holders was pulled for each sample company, that allowed for the following metrics to be calculated: percentage of total shares held by institutions with over $100 million in Equity Assets Under Management ( EAUM ), percentage of total filers with over $450 million in EAUM, percentage of total shares held by institutions with over $450 million in EAUM, percentage of total filers with over $3.5 billion in EAUM, and percentage of total shares held by institutions with over $3.5 billion in EAUM. Each metric percentage was then averaged across the 30 stock sample group. Table 4 1. Scope . The data used for the analysis presented is based on the S&P Capital IQ list of activists.61 Only activists holding over $100 million in EAUM were used in the dataset. 61 According to S&P Capital IQ, an entity (usually a hedge fund or a private investment fund) is flagged as activist based on one of the following criteria: ( i) any entity or individual investor who describes themselves as an activist (sourced from websites , regulatory filings, news articles, etc.). This also includes other factors such as the firm ’s primary business activities and strategy, ( ii) investors currently involved in an activism campaign against a particular company. The impact the firm is try ing to make through the campaign is considered. Generally, the more serious the impact, the more chances of the investor bein g 23 2. Categorizing. The data was then broken into three ranges based on the EAUM of the activist. The three ranges are: $3.5 billion or more, $450 to $3.5 billion, and $100 to $450 million. 3. Analytics . The complete list of publicly filed positions was pulled for each activist. The total dollar value was then calculated for all positions within three separate market cap italization ranges : $10 billion or more , $2 to $10 billion, and less than $2 billion. The total values were summed across each activist group for the final totals. labeled as an activist and (iii) investors with previous activism history is another criterion taken under consideration. Additionally, some firms who might have waged an activist campaign would still not be flagged as activists if they do not conform to the guidelines ( e.g., companies with primary firm type of bank or traditional money managers are not flagged as activists even if the company has waged campaigns ). 24 Exhibit B 13F Comment Letter Survey Results Public Company-Only 13F Comment Letter Survey 1 / 310.00% 0 4.46% 7 15.92% 25 31.85% 50 43.95% 69 3.82% 6 0.00% 0Q1 What is your market cap?

Our base consists of smaller funds and institutions, and if this rule change goes through, we would lose almost all visibility into our base other than with respect to 13G and 13D filers.8/31/2020 2:21 PM 54 This will severely limit our visibility into our share ownership - we have done the analysis and it will have a very negative impact on us.8/31/2020 1:42 PM 55 knowledge base would be diminished 8/31/2020 1:36 PM 56 Wrong direction--need parity with company's disclosure obligations--even with current rule, very one sided.8/31/2020 1:31 PM 57 All transparency in Company's ownership lost outside of greater than 5% holders 8/31/2020 1:26 PM Public Company-Only 13F Comment Letter Survey 7 / 3158 Lack of visibility of holders as by far the majority of our shares are being held by funds which would not have to report their holdings anymore.8/31/2020 1:19 PM 59 Lack of transparency and risk of rogue shareholders. 8/31/2020 1:16 PM 60 lack of visibility 8/31/2020 1:15 PM 61 The proposal limits transparency. 8/31/2020 1:07 PM 62 See my answer to number 3. 8/31/2020 1:00 PM 63 $100 million to $3.5 billion is too big of an increase and would eliminated approximately 65% of holders reporting today8/31/2020 12:51 PM 64 It will make it even harder to ascertain who our shareholders are, who we should be engaging with, and whether there are activists investors in our stock.8/31/2020 12:51 PM 65 Hinders activism monitoring; lack of transparency 8/31/2020 12:38 PM 66 We will lose important information about our shareholders. 8/31/2020 12:27 PM 67 it would make it considerably more difficult for many issuers to understand and engage with our shareholder base; this probably would be particularly acute at smaller companies, which are often held by smaller institutions that would fall below the proposed reporting threshold. While there’s a possibility that some funds below the reporting threshold would continue to report their holdings voluntarily (as most institutions filed their 1Q 2020 13Fs “on time” despite being granted an extension), many would likely take advantage of the increased leniency; whereas many funds had concerns regarding the “optics” of being perceived to take advantage of the pandemic by filing after the original 1Q 2020 deadline, I would expect that the prospect of never having to file 13Fs again would be too enticing for some to pass up. If anything, the $100m reporting threshold and 45-day post-quarter filing deadline should both be reduced, particularly given the advances in technology and increase in shareholder activism since the rules were written.8/31/2020 12:24 PM 68 It significantly decreases transparency, which is contrary to nearly every disclosure rule change the SEC has implemented in recent and not-so-recent memory. While the 45-day period limits the practical utility of these reports (why isn't this being updated instead?), it doesn't make logical sense to expect more and more transparency from issuers but less from significant investors.8/31/2020 12:23 PM 69 Decreased visibiity into our shareholder base. 8/31/2020 12:22 PM 70 Less visibility into stockholders 8/31/2020 12:19 PM 71 Eliminates insights into who holds the company's stock 8/31/2020 12:19 PM 72 Unavailability of useful information if adopted. 8/31/2020 12:11 PM 73 Lack of transparency; ability of activists to accumulate a position with no visibility 8/31/2020 12:11 PM 74 Lack of transparency will limit our ability to identify, engage with and respond to shareholders and their concerns. The Nom/Gov Committee won't be able to factor in the policies of many of our significant holders if ownership is unknown.8/31/2020 12:08 PM 75 Lack of visibility into who major shareholders are; being surprised by an activist who has been able to acquire a sizable stake without the company knowing8/31/2020 12:07 PM 76 Lack of transparency around hedge fund activism and undermine our ability to engage with investors.8/31/2020 12:07 PM 77 The proposal reduces transparency making it more difficult to identify institutional investors. There is currently relatively little compliance cost for institutional investors, so reducing transparency seems unjustified.8/31/2020 12:05 PM 78 Less transparency and visibility 8/31/2020 12:01 PM 79 Tracking investors 8/31/2020 11:58 AM 80 Less transparency which could lead to instability and short-term activist activity that is opportunistic and against the interest of long-term investors.8/31/2020 11:58 AM 81 Lack of transparency; the company has a right to know who owns its shares as well as be 8/31/2020 11:57 AM Public Company-Only 13F Comment Letter Survey 8 / 31aware of trends. 82 The Company is not opposed with a higher threshold, but given the significantly higher threshold, we would not be able to identify the majority of our shareholder base outside of the >5% owners.8/31/2020 11:53 AM 83 It would drastically reduce our visibility of changes in the ownership of our stock, which is nearly 90% institutionally held. It would negatively affect our ability to engage with our largest stockholders, which we do every year in the off-season. The rule needs to be ""modernized"", but in other ways (more frequent reports, and closer to the report date - not 45 days from the end of the quarter). A change of the magnitude in terms of dollar amount that is proposed would be extremely harmful, in our opinion.8/31/2020 11:53 AM 84 Lack of transparency into investors and changes in holdings. 8/31/2020 11:52 AM 85 Proposed new reporting threshold is way too high!!! 8/31/2020 11:52 AM 86 Lack of visibility into shareholders initiating positions in our stock. 8/31/2020 11:51 AM 87 Lack of transparency; inability to proactively engage with institutional investors and understand investor perspectives, particularly on proposals to be voted on.

Despite the large number of filings and operational costs this brings to the SEC, the empowerment that increased information provides visibility in a market that is teetering on a razor's edge of investor confidence.

"Lucy Lu, Sixth Street Specialty Lending",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860048-223907.pdf,,"1 September 29, 20 20 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34- 89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Sixth Street Specialty Lending, In c. (NYSE: TSLX) , a business development company (“BDC”) with offices in New York, San Francisco , Boston and Dallas , we are writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. The SEC’s proposal, which would remove reporting obligations for approximately 90% of current 13F filers, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and our public ly traded peers . We are concerned that t he proposed rule amendments , if enacted, w ould limit our ability to attract new long -term investors to facilitate further capital formation, impede our and the BDC sector’s ability to engag e with institutional shareholders on important corporate governance matter s, and structurally increase shareholder costs and lower shareholder returns . The 13F filings are the only source of reliable quarterly ownership information available to our company and other issuers in the United States . In addition, 13F information is the only ownership data that shows which “street name” investors (i.e., investors who opt to hold their securities under the names of the ir brokerage firms) are buying or selling our shares. Without access to such information, our investor engagement activities will be severely constrained. We do not believe that the 13F proposal has adequately taken into consideration the potential impact of the amendments to the reporting rules to companies like ours and our need to regularly interact with our investors throughout the year . As a small cap company with approximately $1.2 billion of market cap italization , we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of transparency provided by 13F data would impair our ability to identify our beneficial shareholders 2 and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion w ould allow 82 out of the current 168 13F filers , or approximately 30% of our shares outstanding that report holdings , to be excluded from disclosure and reporting obligations .1 Significant investors (i.e., those who own > 1% of our shares outstanding) w ho would “go dark ” include some of our longest and most active holders .1 Issuers in the BDC sector are mostly smaller cap companies, and therefore, we believe the proposed amendments will have an outsized impact on our sector as a whole. Currently, approximately 80% of publicly -traded BDCs have a market cap italization of less t han $1 billion , which means that our sector is likely to have meaningful exposure to investors with less than $3.5 billion of 13F securities . 2 As a result, we believe the impact of the reduction of 13F reporting thresholds will be significant across the B DC sector . For our company and our sector , the 13F data , especially data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold , provides valuable insight into our shareholder composition and evolution over time for the reasons set forth below .3 4 Capital Formation The loss of data provided under the existing 13F reporting framework would also impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in our peers) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . We believe b oth of these practices are essential for our company to effe ctively access the capital markets , grow our business , and create value for our shareholders . Without this information on who is holding and buying our shares each quarter, we believe our efforts in raising growth capital would be less effective . Consisten t with the agency’s mission, we believe that the SEC should more f ully consider the impact on public company capital formation , particularly on smaller cap companies like ours, before proceeding with this rule making . Engagement with Institutional Shareholder s and Engagement Relating to Governance Our company uses 13F data as an important tool for proactive investor engagement. In order to best allocat e our management’s time, we identify not only our largest investors, but also those 1 Based on latest 13F filings as of September 2020 .

With the proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important shareholder group. In addition, visibility into this group’s holdings in our stock over time (as well as holdings in the stock of our BDC peers) provide s valuable insight on potential shareholder sentiments or concerns about our company and our sector . This allows our management team to more productive ly engage with our shareholders . We believe t he loss of data provided under the existing 13F reporting framework exposes our company and the BDC sector to a greater risk of less effective corporate governance. The BDC sector has a predominantly retail-oriented shareholder base, with an average of only 22.3% institutional ownership for publicly-traded BDCs.5 The limited institutional ownership, coupled with more stringent quorum requirements under the 1940 Act for certain matters voted on at BDC shareholder meetings , already constrain the effective exercise of shareholder rights in our sector. In order to achieve quorum s on these important company proposals, BDCs rely heavily on 13F data to engage with their shareholders to encourage and facilitate voting participation. As an illustration of this , we rely heavily on 13F data to engage with and solicit votes from our institutional investors on shareholder meeting proposals . We (and other BDCs) are required to satisfy stricter meeting quorum thresholds for certain proposals as required under the 1940 Act . For example, i n order to hold our special meeting of shareholders this May , where our shareholders approved our ability to issue shares of our common stock below net asset value per share , we needed to satisfy , amongst other requirements, a quorum of 50% of outstanding shares excluding shares held by affiliates , which by definitio n excluded our >5% holders. To meet this quorum requirement , we needed voting participation from nearly all our remaining institutional shareholder base. The 13F data provided valuable insight into who our <5% institutional shareholder s were and allowed us to proactively reach out to encourage voting participation from these holders . Using 13F data (along with significant outreach efforts from our IR team), we were able to achieve the non-affiliate quorum by a small margin, without having to adjourn and reschedule the meeting in order to solicit additional votes to meet the non -affiliate quorum . Under the proposed rule, over 40% of our target voter outreach base would go dark and stop providing 13F data , thereby significantly impairing our ability to achieve the required quorum at future special meetings . Structural Increase in Shareholder Costs and Leading to Lower Shareholder Returns Without the ownership data provided under the existing 13F reporting framework that enables us to identify investors to encourage voting participation, w e believe our company and our sector would likely experience delays in outcomes for important shareholder meeting proposals due to the lack of a quorum , and possibly not be able to achieve a quorum at all . Having to postpone, adjourn or cancel and reschedule a meeting would also likely lead to a notable increase in proxy 5 Source: Raymond James BDC Weekly Insight , September 18, 2020. 4 solicitation costs that would be borne by shareholders in the form of higher costs and lower investment returns. Illustratively, if we were to double the printing and solicitation expenses we incurred during our 2020 p roxy season, it would have resulted in an incremental two basis point reducti on to our annualized return on equity. We believe this would result in a reduction to our market capitalization of approximately $2.7 million based on a 10x price -to-earnings trading multiple .6 In summary, w e believe that shareholders play an important role in strong and effective corporate governance, and our concern is that this proposal , if adopted, would fundamentally alter the ability of BDCs like our company to solicit votes from their shareholders . This would affect not only director elections, but also non-routine proposals and other important governance matters . At the same time, it would burden shareholders with incremental costs (and lower returns) and potential meeting delays as required quorums are sought . Contrary to the SEC’s goal of investor protection and oversight, we believe the proposed 13F amendments and its impact on corporate governance would be to the ultimate detriment of public company shareholders. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments . Rather than reduc e 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to consider the feedback on how ownership transparency is important (in various ways) in companies’ abilities to best serve their shareholders.

WATIKER September 29, 2020 Vanessa A. Countryman , Esq. Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: Comments on Proposed Rules Relating to the Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On July 10, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commis- sion”) propos ed an amendment to Form 13F that would increase the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion (the “Proposed Amendment”). We respectfully submit this letter in response to the solicitation by the Commission for comments on the Proposed Amendme nt. As discussed in more detail below, we believe that the Proposed Amendment would decrease market transparency, increase the potential for covert activist behavior and mar- ket manipulation, reduce the ability of U.S. public companies to engage with invest ors in a meaningful and efficient manner, and deprive investors, companies and the Commission itself of valuable, decision -useful information. The justification advanced by the Commission for the Proposed Amendment —purported savings of $15,000 – $30,000 a nnually by the “smaller” insti- -2- tutions that would no longer be subject to filing requirements under Section 13(f) of the Securi- ties Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Section 13(f)”) —underestimates the market influence of such institutions, likely overestim ates the potential savings to those institutions, ignores other costs of the Proposed Amendment and in any event is insufficient to justify the adverse effects of the Proposed Amendment. The Proposed Amendment cuts the information currently available from Form 13Fs by 90%, rendering investors, regulators and the American public blind to im- portant developments affecting the future of major American companies on whom our nation de- pends for job creation and overall prosperity. That said, we support the Commi ssion in taking a long overdue look at the Sec- tion 13 rule regime . For too long, the Commission’s rules have lagged important market devel- opments, leaving the U.S. regulatory scheme out of sync with best practices internationally . And the Commission’s cu rrent rules fail to serve Section 13 ’s intended purpose and unnecessarily keep investors (including Main Street investors ), regulators and the public in the dark about im- portant market developments that have a serious effect on all the stakeholders of American pub- lic companies, including their employees and communities of operation. Part of the outdated na- ture of the Section 13 regulatory scheme, all must admit, involves the failure of the thresholds under Rule 13f to be kept relevant in terms of current market conditions. But the minor effect on the smallest of investment funds is trivial in light of technological improveme nts that make re- porting in a timely and complete way less burdensome than ever , and in any event does not jus- tify exempting much larger funds from filing under Ru le 13f . What is needed given these realities is a comprehensive re-examination of the en- tire Section 13 rule regime in light of market and technological developments that have rendered the current regulatory landscape badly out of date and incapable of serving its intended purposes. But, rather than undertake a sensible rebalancing of the threshold under Rule 13f in the context of a broader examination of Rule 13, the Commission is proposing to act in a piecemeal fashion that will make the current, sub optimal situation even worse. The primary problem with Rule 13 now is not that it requir es too much timely reporting, but that it requires too little. And, funda- mentally, the Commission’s Rules are antiquated and fail to capture important positions like de- rivatives that are standard grist for the mill of investment funds, have material impli cations for the control of public companies , and are covered by the reporting rules of virtually every major capitalist econ omy except the United States. We understand and regret that the rules implement- ing Section 13 have been used as a political footbal l by interest groups of all kinds, and the cor- responding and natural temptation for the Commission to try to proceed in a discrete way that it may pe rceive as less controversial. But, it is precisely the failure of the current proposal to situ- ate Rule 13f reform in the context of the overall deficiency of the current Section 13 rule scheme that leads us to oppose the Commission’s current approach . There is a sensible way forward to consider whether to raise the Rule 13f report- ing threshold in a meaningful, but measured way, that takes into account the effect of inflation and relieves the burden on holders who se positions are not materially important in the context of current markets. But any increase should occur only simultaneous with reforms t o rules imple- menting Section 13 to require: (1) reporting of all derivative and similar positions under all sub- sections of Rule 13 ; (2) that investors filing under Rule 13d cease trading once they hit the 5% threshold until 48 hours after they make their i nitial filing under the rule; and (3) that Schedule 13D filers make their initial filing within one business day of crossing the ownership threshold, -3- and update their filings within 24 hours of any change in position of more than one percent in any directi on. Within the context of this overall reform, an increase of the Rule 13f threshold may well make sense, and the benefit -to-cost ratio of the entire Section 13 regime would im- prove immeasurably. Under that sensible approach to comprehensive reform, publ ic companies, their stakeholders and regulators would have more timely and complete information about criti- cal market developments, stockholders would be able to assess more accurately the economic motivations of activist investors and small investment fun ds whose positions are not material to the functioning of our capital markets and for whom the existing Section 13(f) regime might rea- sonably be considered a meaningful burden can be relieved of the need to file.1 In the absence of an overall reform that takes into account the crucial market de- velop ments that have rendered the current Rule 13 regime unable to fulfill its inten ded purpose, we oppose the narrow Proposed Amendment. As a standalone idea, increasing the reporting thresholds of Rule 13f is unwise. Precisely because of the failure to keep all aspects of Rule 13 current, Rule 13f now plays an important role as a stopgap early w arning system because it is what issuers and the public must look to in the absence of a modern Rule 13 d. Taking action to reduce the number of Form 13F reporting filers by 90% would leave American investors, issuers and the general public even more in the dark about important developments in our economy and make us an even greater lagg ard in transparency and disclosure internationally . Reducing overall market transparency , when the existing level of transparency is suboptimal, is a step backwards. Any increase to the Rule 13f threshold must be but one part of a comprehensive reform to all the rules implementing Section 1 3. Brief History of Section 13(f) At its core, the purpose of Section 13(f) is to improve transpare ncy in the securi- ties markets.2 In 1971, the Commission recommended that Congress empower it to require re- ports and disclosure of securities holdings from “all types of institutional investment managers.”3 In 197 5, Congress took this recommendation and enacted Section 13(f) , emphasizing three pri- mary needs that it was ful filling: (1) the need for corporate issuers to be able to identify the holders of their stock in light of the “unnecessary secrecy” caused by the practice of institutional investors using “street names” ;4 (2) the need to create a depository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment manag ers;5 and (3) the need to rapidly disseminate institutional disclosure information to the public, thereby stimulating a higher degree of investor confidence in the integrity of the securities markets.6 1 We have previously submitted a detailed proposal to reform Schedule 13D reporting and believe that those recommenda- tions remain sound and could be the basis of comprehensive reform that could involve measured changes to the Rule 13f filing threshold. See generally Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13 of the Securi- ties Exchange Act of 1934 (Mar. 7, 2011), https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2011/petn4 -624.pdf (the “WLRK Section 13 Petition”). 2 S.

Section 13(d) was supposed to alert issuers and the public of potential m oves to exert influence or take control of a particular company .8 But, as the deficiencies of Rule 13d became evident, public companies and investors became increasingly relia nt on Rule 13f —origi- nally “an ownership reporting provision of general applicati on”—to fill in the blanks left by the Section 13(d) early warning system. In a practical , real-world sense, Rule 13f became one of the key source s of important market transparency. Harms of the Proposed Amendment Since the Commission last updated its rules under Section 13 in a comprehensive way, seismic and well -understood changes have occurred in our capital markets.9 Through the use of derivatives and other synthetic instruments, it is now possible for a n activist or passive in- vestor to accumul ate much greater amounts of ownership while escaping the need for imme diate disclosure. The Commission’s rules under both subsections (f) and (d) fail to capture this im- portant development, and lag international standards among the leading market -based ec ono- mies. Unlike w hen the rules were crafted, it is much easier for investors to accumulate large bloc ks of stock rapidly and in non-transparent ways, and to accumulate control over much more than 5% of a company’s voting stock before the Commission’s rules require public disclo- sure.10 This has made our markets less transparent. 7 See H.R. Rep. No. 90 -1711, at 2818 (1968) (“The purpose of section 13(d) is to require disclosure of information by per- sons who have acquired a substantial interest, or increased their interest in the equity securities of a company by a substan- tial amount, within a relatively short period of time.”); S.

Milstein , 453 F.2d 709, 717 (2d Cir. 1971) (“[T]he purpose of section 13(d) is to alert the marketplace to every large, rapid aggregation or accu- mulation of securities, regardless of technique employed, which might re present a potential shift in corporate con- trol . . . .”). 8 Filing and Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Exchange Act Release No. 15348, 16 SEC Docket 228 (Nov. 22, 1978) (citing S.

See the Dodd‐Frank Act, Pub. L. No. 111‐203, 124 Stat 1376 (2010), § 929R. Section 766 of the Dodd Frank explicitly empowered the Commission to expand the definition of beneficial ownership. See id. at § 766. 10 See infra notes 54 -63 and accompanying text. -5- Ironically, this development has been facilitated by investors taking advantage of the ten -day reporting deadline under Rule 13(d), which was set at a time when filers had to pre- pare a filing on a typewriter and arrange for it to be delivered to the nation’s capital, in a ti me- consuming manner. In the 21st century, it has never been easier for filers to compile information in a timely and accurate way , and file it promptly by electronic means. As things now stand , because the Commission’s rules have not kept pace with the speed of markets and tech nology, American issuers, stockholders and the public are blind to in- formation that is more rapidly available in other nation s like the United Kingdom ,11 Germany12 and Hong Kong .13 For that reason, the disclosure that is required under Form 13F today plays an even more indispensable role in fostering information flows and market transparency, and thus promoting investor confidence in the securities markets.14 Form 13F data has not become less useful with market developments ; it has become more important because it is needed to cover territory that Section 13(d) was supposed to address but does not . Thus , the Co mmission itself acknowledges that Form 13F has become more important and that more types of users than ever now rely on this data.15 In our view, the Proposed Amendment does not sufficiently weigh the harm that the reduced threshold will cause to the inte rest of market participants , stakeholders and the pub- lic generally. We encourage the Commission to give serious consideration to the damage that the Proposed Amendment would cause to the transparency of the securities markets. To help in the consideration of needed change , we next explain concretely some of the harm that shrinking public discl osure so drastically will have. Reduced Ability to Verify Investment Assertions Reducing mandatory reporters by 90% will make it more difficult for in vestors to screen “smaller” managers and to confirm that such “smaller” managers are investing in accord- ance with their marketing assertions.16 Increased m arket opacity could enable bad -acting manag- ers, newly free from disclosure requirements, to conceal e vidence that they are not investing ac- cording to fund type . And in the absence of Form 13F data, investors would have little way of knowing. This lack of certainty threatens Congress’s “[p]erhaps most important justification ” for Section 13(f): “the nee d to collect and disseminate to individual investors data about institu- 11 See Chapter 5 of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules Sourcebook . 12 See Part 6 of the German Securities Trading Act. 13 See Part XV of the Hong Kong Securit ies Futures Ordinance. 14 See Senate Report at 79 -85. As the Commission correctly noted, the “data can also assist individuals in making invest- ment decisions, investment managers in managing assets, and corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in d etermin- ing the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock. ” Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Ex- change Act Release No. 34 -89290 at 22. (emphasis added). (“Proposed Amendment”). 15 See Proposed Amendment at 21 –22. 16 See, e.g., Corrie Driebusch and Juliet Chung, SEC Rule Proposal Would Slash Number of Investment Managers That Need to Report Quarterly Holdings , Wall St. J. (July 10, 2020), https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec -rule-proposal -would - slash -number -of-investment -managers -that-need -to-report -quarterly -holdings -11594429438. -6- tional investment managers [and, thus,] stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all inves- tors in the integrity of [the] securities markets.”17 The Proposed Amendment would leave indi- vidual investors without much of that data and, as a result , without one of its more valuable due diligence tools. The loss of this verification mechanism may chill investor appetite , hinder ing market -wide capital formation. Decreased Availability of Decision -Useful Information Congress’s intent in enacting Section 13(f) was, in part, to ensure “that infor- mation about the securities holdings and certain transactions of institutional investment managers [is] available to a ll investors —both institutional and individual —so that they can have it, what- ever its relative usefulness in making their independent judgements.”18 Exempting 90% of Form 13F reporters will deprive institutional managers of useful data points and harm thei r ability to make informed judgements about the market. For instance, lack of transparency would harm the already -limited ability of in- vestment managers to detect crowded trades and to invest accordingly. That is , investment man- agers would have a difficult time deciphering whether a security is experiencing pri ce increases due to fundamental factors or as a result of a short -term play by a collection of hedge funds making similar trades at about the same time. The aggressive accumulation of a sec urity by hedge funds (and the later accumulation by those who wish to take advantage of the volatility arising from these situations ) typically result s in the inflation of the price of that security . These exaggerated stock prices can plunge to fire -sale prices once the synchronized hedge funds unload the security, leaving the other investors and investment managers holding on to an illiquid secu- rity.19 Reduced valuation information Without visibility into the shareholder base of potential investments, it can be dif- ficult to value securities with any precision . As Congress noted, “[a]ccurate valuation of large securities holdings is the touchstone of investor confidence in investment management relation- ships.”20 Of course, market visibility is a critical component of security valuation, especially if it offers insight into the positioning of short -term investors and market movers. It is, therefore, in- advisable for the Commission to reduce decision -useful information so drastically . In this re- spect, the impact of the Proposed Amendment is predictable: less institutional disclosure data could harm the ability of managers to gauge the holdings of other institutional investors and, thus, accurately value securities, which in turn could subject investors to increased unpredictabil- ity (and likely associated losses) and diminish investor faith in investment managers and the mar- kets generally. Ultimately, this will hurt issuer s’ ability to raise capital on the markets.

Domestic and international investors also use Form 13F data to un- derstand who their co -investors ar e in specific companies and industry sectors, assess turnover and trading styles and inform investment decisions. Negative impact on the M&A market Additionally, the Commission should note that Form 13F data play an important role in the public M&A market. Specifically, business combination and transaction counterpar- ties rely on Form 13F information as part of the due diligence process. Without this data, it would be more difficult for potential buyers –and sellers –to assess possible partners or str ategic counterparties in M&A -related transactions. Many companies, as well as their advisors, find it useful, and even important, to have 13(f) reports in order to assess a counterparty’s ownership base, evaluate its stability or level of churn over time, determine shareholder overlap (which can factor into valuation assessments) and identify which investors are aligned or misaligned with a company’s strategic direction and value creation strategies or may otherwise seek to intervene in or influence a part icipant company’s future or seek to interfere with or block the successful exe- cution of a proposed transaction. Depriving transaction participants of 13(f) information , as the Proposed Amendment would do, could have the unintended effect of chilling M&A a ctivity and undermine the market for corporate control, increasing costs (and decreasing the efficiency) of public M&A transactions and heightening the risks for potential buyers and sellers by depriving them of decision -useful information. Increase the Potential for Covert Activist Tactics and Market Manipulation As we have mentioned, Form 13F filings now act in fact, if not by original inten- tion, as part of the early warning system for issue rs, other stockholders and the public , designed to sound upon emergence of an investor that may wish to change the company’s strategi c direc- tion in material ways. Issuers, other stockholders and the public now rely on Rule 13f as an early warning because of the gaps in Rule 13d’s coverage of derivatives and synthetics, and the delays in requiring re porting once an activist investor accumulates 5%. To gut required disclosure under Form 13F would leave issuers, public investors and regulators even more blind to the reality that an activist investor has taken an influential po- sition in a public company. The Proposed Amendment would facilitate the covert actions of activist investors, enabling them to accumulate and leverage positions beyond the reac h of statutorily contemplated public scrutiny. At the same time, activists will continue to collectivize into so-called “wolf packs” (that is, groups operating with conscious parallelism but no formal “agreement” as would require a 13D filing) further ci rcumventing disclosures and ultimately undermining investor con- fidence in the integrity of the securities markets.21 The combination of market opacity and ac- tivist “tipping” enables coordinated activist attacks, leaving corporate issuers and other investo rs 21 See John C. Coffee, Jr. & Darius Palia, The Wolf at the Door: The Impact of Hedge Fund Activism on Corporate Gov- ernance , 41 J. C ORP. L. 545, 565 –66 (2016); see also Leo E. Strine, Jr., Who Bleeds When the Wolves Bite?: A Flesh -and- Blood Perspective on Hedge Fund Activism and Our Strange Corporate Governance System , 126 YALE L.J. 1870, 1896 – 97 (2017). -8- flatfooted.22 When such an activist’s position is finally revealed , the disclosure tends to move the market materially . The activist and the favored few that were tipped enjoy outsized returns , often to the detriment of Main Street investors deprived of the same knowledge.23 The Commission is empowered to protect the publ ic interest against such tactics . Accordingly, Congress indicated that it expected the Commission to use Form 13F data “to ana- lyze the characteristics of institutional investment ma nagers, and to analyze the impact of institu- tional investment managers on the securities markets.”24 Reducing the reporting of Form 13F data by 90% will hinder the Commission’s ability to perform its statutorily contemplated role — especially given the outsi zed impact of many of the sophisticated investors that would be ex- empted by the Proposed Amendment. Indeed, as a result of the Proposed Amendment, many of those such sophisticated investors could evade the 13F disclosure requirement by apportioning their positions to avoid the $3.5 billion threshold. Impair Shareholder Identification and Engagement Corporate issuers rely on Form 13F data. Public companies use 13F data to fa- miliarize themselves with their shareholder base, given that “much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.”25 And, Congress intended precisely such use of Form 13F data.26 Section 13(f)’s legislative history notes that the practice of listing holdings in ‘street name ’ “may impede company management in its attempts to com- municate directly with the beneficial owners of its securities” and provides that Section 13(f) was “carefully drawn in response to the problem.”27 Decreased shareholder visibility also hinders the ability of issuers to analyze their current shareholder base , identify gaps and opportunities for improving the composition of their investor base and target new potential investors. As many companies have experienced, some investors (including activist funds) are tight-lipped and vague when companies ask directly how much company stock they hold, and the 13Fs help keep them honest and at least provide a starting point for dialogue. The Proposed Amendment would largely reverse a n effective solution to a problem ide ntified by Congress and the Commission it- self. 22 See Adam Emmerich, David Silk, Sabastian Niles and Oluwatomi Williams, Going Dark: SEC Proposes Amendments to Form 13F (2020), https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/07/19/going -dark-sec-proposes -amendments -to-form -13f/ (noting that the increased threshold will make it significantly more difficult to discern whether an activist, or a wolf pack, owns a stake in company and that “activist ‘tipping’ could well result in only the wolf pack —and not the target company or other shareholders —being aware of the ownership stake until the moment the activist strike occurs.”); Susan Pulliam et al., Ac- tivist Investors Often Leak Their Plans to a Favored Few: Strategically Placed Tips Build Alliances for Campaigns at Tar- get Companies , Wall Street J.

It is likely that if the Proposed Amendment is adopted , some activist investors will b uild secret stakes in companies and go undetected (except to the “wolf pack” members they have tipped) until right before they decide to launch their attack on an issuer . In response, corporate issuers will have to allocate more resources, time and e ffort to protect against th is heightened threat posed by activists’ covert equity accumulation. The time, e ffort and capital would be better utilized creating real value for shareholders . Smaller corporate issuers will be especially disadvantaged by the Proposed Amendment , as it will reduce their shareholder visibility most drastically .28 These companies have fewer resources to pay consultants and market surveillance firms to attempt to identify who their shareholders are and whether any activists are in their stock . And, although the decrease in shareholder visibility for larger issuers will be lower than that suffered by smaller issuers29, given the size of larger companies’ shareholder bases , reducing by 90% the reporters of Form 13F data would in many cases deprive even large cap issuers of the opportunity to proactively identify and engage with potentially disruptive shareholders, who in many cases have an impact beyond their holdings. Notably, the Proposed Amendment would have economy -wide implications, spar- ing few industries, with a large majority losing more than 10% of industry -wide shareholder visi- bility.30 And the actual impact of the Proposed Amendment w ill vary across industries, creating additional un predictability .31 We respectfully submit that the Proposed Amendment did not fully contend with these concerns and left important interests of corporate issuers largely un- addressed.32 Inadequate Alternatives to Form 13F The “alternative sources of holdings data” that the Commission suggests as viable substitutes for Form 13F ( i.e., Schedule 13D and Form N -PORT) are insufficient replacements.33 For instance, Schedule 13D is applicable only to investors that acquire more th an 5% of a com- pany’s equity securities. Accordingly , it is typically irrelevant to large -cap companies. And as 28 See Shannon McDermott, SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Inv estor Analysis , IHS Markit (Aug. 7, 2020), https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ (testing the Proposed Amendment on the Russell 3000 to identify its potential impact). The impact of the Proposed Amendment varies widely by market cap. According to the IHS analysis, mega cap and large cap companies would lose 4.4% and 5.5% shareholder visibility , respectively. Id. On the other hand, mid -cap would lose 9.4% shareholder visibility, while small and micro -cap companies would lose 14.6% and 17.1% shareholder visibility, respectively. Id. 29 Id. 30 See id. (providing that the following industries will each lose more than 10% of its shareholder visibility: Financials (10.4%), Consumer Goods (10.6%), Industrials (10.8%), Technology (12.8%), Consumer Services (13.8%), Healthcare (14.9%) and Energy (16.5%)). 31 For example, the visibility into investors that focus on industries that experience significant valuation changes, such as the energy sector, may be especially harmed by the Proposed Amendment. 32 We also acknowledge and support the Commission’s recommen dations to require managers to provide additional identi- fying information, including to better reveal interrelationships between managers sharing investment discretion, and elimi- nate the Form 13F omission threshold and associated share / value limits. 33 See Proposed Amendment at 24 –25 n.58. -10- we have explained , Section 13(d) disclosure is now subject to abuse and circumvention by so- phisticated investors and is in serious need of reform itself.34 Form N -PORT too is a n inade- quate alternative. It requires information from only registered investment companies. The in- vestors that file on Form N -PORT make up a small percentage of the would -be exempt Form 13F filers. Additionally, Form N -PORT’s 60-day disclosure window offers even staler data than the current Section 13 (f) regime does. At one point in its comments on the Proposed Amendment , the Commission im- plies that market surveillance firms could replicate Form 13F information.35 This is a generous assumption , at best . For starters, Form 13F filings are themselves the most reliable (if sometimes outdated) information market surveillance firms have available to them. Give n the multiple lay- ers of intermediaries in general and the lengths activists will go to in order to remain hidden, market surveillance is more of an exercise in guesswork than a precision science . And not all surveillance firms are created equal ; access to the most accurate and timely information cost s more . As a result, market participants and stakeholders would effectively be required to pay a premium to market surveillance firms for reduced market transparency. In all likelihood, t he cost of Section 13(f) compliance saved by “smaller” managers would be passed on to those will- ing to pay for (less reliable) information from surveillance firms. Indeed, there will be those — such as smaller issuers —who just cannot afford such a service a nd will have to navigate blindly the muddier waters of turbulent markets . We respectfully believe that t he Commission should give greater consideration to the broad use of Form 13F data and the dearth of suitable alterna- tives , lest inadequate and unequal access to critical market information reduce the integrity of our securities markets. Overestimat ed Burden of Reporting Generally speaking, improved technology has substantially reduced the cost of aggregating, storing, preparing and filing Form 13F disclosure information. The Commission itself acknowledges that “the direct compliance costs associated with preparing filings on Form 13F have decreased . . . principally due to lower -cost information processing systems.”36 Addi- tionally, the substantive requirements of Form 13F filings are, in most cases, basic.37 Investment managers already keep track of the required Form 13F data, independent of any disclosure re- quirement. This process is automated, sav ing time and reduc ing associated labor cost s. Accord- ingly, the Commission’s estimate of Section 13(f) compliance costs, $15,000 to $30,000 per manager, seems overstated.38 34 See, e.g. , WLRK Section 13 Petition . 35 See Proposed Amendment at 24 n. 57. 36 Id. at 13. 37 Institutional investment managers must report the following on Form 13F: (1) The issuer name of all Section 13(f) se- curities; (2) a description of the class of security listed; (3) the number of securities owned; and (4) the fair market value of the secu rities listed, as of the end of the calendar quarter. See Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F, U.S. Securi- ties and Exchange Commission (Feb. 24, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm. 38 Notably, this estimate is a sharp departu re from the SEC’s own previous calculation of the same burden, which amounted to approximately $4,000 to $5,000 annually per manager. See Allison Herren Lee, Commissioner, U.S. Securi- ties and Exchange Commission, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10 (“Commissioner Lee Statement”). -11- Notably, most of the costs enumerated by the Commission were not specific to managers filing on Form 13F. Instead, they were gen eral compliance costs, which in most cases would persist even in the absence of the Section 13(f) filing requirement. For instance, managers do not “develop [] and maintain [] hardware and software systems to collect and analyze infor- mation” singularly for the purpose of filing on Form 13F.39 Nor do they undertak e “reviews or compliance activities as part of [their] overall compliance program” specifically to file on Form 13F.40 The main cost associated exclusively with filing on Form 13F is “preparing the i nfor- mation for submission to the EDGAR system.”41 This additional cost is minimal. Although it is true that there can be, as the Commission notes , costs associated with submitting confidential treatment requests (“CTRs”) ,42 these requests are indulgences typi- cally requested by activists or other sophisticated investors from the general rule in favor of mar- ket transparency because they perceive an opportunity to profit by acting in secret and shielding their actions from scrutiny by other market participa nts. Indeed, the existence of Form 13F CTRs has often been criticized for its ambiguity and susceptibility to manipulation43 and the added costs undertaken by activist s or other sophisticated investors to earn outsize profit s by covert conduct is no reason to dramatically reduce the transparency needed by all other market participants. The Proposed Amendment mentions indirect costs to “smaller” managers, namely the potential for front -running and copycatting. In both cases, the Commission acknowledged that the studies upon which it relied neither test nor conclusively establish causal relationships or to what extent investment managers are harmed specifically by front -running and copycatting.44 In any case, in our view neither contention warrants reduc ing m arket transparency . The front- running concerns seem misplaced. Form 13F disclosure occurs after the investor has acquired the security and is often fashioned s o that it offers little live information to the market . The “copycatting” argument essentially posits that the market should be kept in the dark while “wolf packs” are able to develop once the activist has accumulated enough in secret and is ready to tip its selected fellow travelers ).45 That proposition is inconsistent with the intended role of Section 13(f). Congress contemplated the use of Form 13F data to better understand “the investment re- sults and investment strategies of different institutional investment managers, including portfolio volatility and portfolio turnover,” and “the share acquisition and disposition of different manag- ers.”46 It should not be considered an undue burden that Section 13(f) provides insight into the 39 Proposed Amendment at 18. 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 See id. 43 Richard Teitebaum, SEC Grants Too Many Confidential Treatment Requests, Critics Say , Institutional Investor (Oct. 7, 2015), https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b14z9xzkxzbfqj/sec -grants -too-many -confidential -treatment -requests - critics -say; see also Christian Bonser, If You Only Knew the Power of the Dark Side: An Analysis of the One-Sided Long Position Hedge Fund Public Disclosure Regime and a Call for Short Position Inclusion , 22 FORDHAM J.

That is the very purpose of the statute. The Commis- sion should not dimin ish market transparency and eliminat e investor access to the investment ac- tivities of many of their managers to protect the desire of a small number of investment managers to reap outsize profits through stealthy behavior .47 Underestimat ed Impact of Smaller Managers So-called “smaller” managers may hold a less substantial percentage of Section 13(f) securities than the largest institutional investors, but they can have the practical ability to materially affect the securities market and the market for most issuers’ securities . Tellingly, out of this year’s top ten activists (in terms of number of high impact campaigns launched), seven fall below the would -be Section 13(f) threshold.48 Eighty percent of the “SharkWatch 50 Key Activists” would be exempt from filing on Form 13F.49 Put plainly, this means a large sup erma- jority of the most influential activists who affect other investors and all the other stakeholders of American companies , including the employees whose hard work is essential to our nation’s e co- nomic success, would be exempt from disclosing their securities holdings to market participants, the Commission and the public. As a result, high profile investors like David Tepper, Paul Tu- dor Jones, and George Soros and well known activist firms such as J ANA Partners, Corvex Part- ners, Sachem Hea d and even Starboard Value, to name a few, would be more easily able, if the Proposed Amendment was passed, to build secret stakes and coordinate attacks on unprepared corporate issuers.50 We respectfully submit that t he risk presented by allowing these “smaller” investors to “go dark,” thereby subjecting the market to increased volatility and eroding investor faith in the securities market s, dwarf s any concern that these investors are unduly burdened by relatively minimal compliance costs. Statutory Intent Congress did not intend strict adherence to the initial, $100 million, reporting threshold —especially not to the detriment of the transparency that Congress sought by enacting Section 13(f ) in the first place. Rather, Congress deliberately set the threshold high, giving the Commission time to phase in any downward refinement it viewed as advisable after the adoption of Section 13(f).51 Indeed, Congress made clear that its initial reporting threshold was largely meant to facilitate the smooth adoption of the new disclosure regime, explaining that “by limit- ing initially the impact of the reporting provisions to the largest institutional managers,” Section 47 Amy Whyte, Is Hedge Fund Secrecy a Sign of Skill – Or a Red Flag? , Institutional Investor (July 20, 2020) , https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1ml 48c86hm5z2/Is -Hedge -Fund -Secrecy -a-Sign-of-Skill -Or-a-Red-Flag# (“The more secretive funds, they found, did not outperform the more transparent funds.

McDermott, supra note 28. 51 We note that other commentators have questioned the authority of the Commission to increase the Form 13F threshold above $100 million. See, e.g., National Investor Relations Institute, Comment Letter Template for NIRI Chapters on 13F (2020); see also Commissioner Lee Statement. We assume for the purposes of our comments that the Commission has the authority to make the change that it is proposing, and focus our comment on why the Proposed Amendment, as is, is un- wise and should not be adopted. -13- 13(f) “could be implemented rapidly w ith the least amount of unnecessary costs and burdens on the potential respondents.”52 Congress explicitly contemplated and authorized the Commission’s reduction of “the securities holdings cut -off figure to [as low as] $10 million.”53 This context is important because it underscores how out of sync the drastic increase contemplated by the Pro- posed Amendment is with the statu tory purposes Section 13(f) was intended to play, and how un- wise it would be to proceed with a piecemeal change that materially decreases market transpar- ency without considering the larger context within which Form 13F filing s now serve as an im- portant integrity -promoting function. Comprehensive Section 13 Reform The Commission has correctly observed that the syste m for disclosure of benefi- cial ownership is long overdue for reform. But, the Proposed Amendment does not address the components of Section 13 most in need of modernization. Over the last decade, we have identi- fied the elements of Section 13 most in need of updating and revision, and proposed key reforms to address such needs. In our 2011 rulemaking petition, we recommended changes to modernize Section 13 and better safeguard the beneficial ownership disclosure regime from misuse and cir- cumvention.54 Others too have recommended comprehensive changes to address the deficiencies of both Sections 13(f) and 13(d).55 Together, these reforms would bring the United States closer in line with most other sophisticated jurisdictions that have already adopted such d isclosure fea- tures (including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong). In the age of ubiquitous technology and free -flowing information, there is no rea- son to blind Americans to even more key market information than is currently the case. Th e ability to collect, maintain and disseminate information is easier and less costly than ever. Given this reality, any changes to the beneficial ownership reporting regime should come in the context of comprehensive reform that increases —rather than decr eases —the amount of meaningful in- formation reported, and decreases the time allotted to do so. For that reason, the piecemeal Pro- posed Am endment is mistaken and any more measured adjustment to the Rule 13f threshold should come in the context of overall reform of Section 13. Such reform is long overdue , and we briefly sketch the contours of what common sense Section 13 reform should look like . 52 Senate Report at 264 (emphasis added) . 53 Id. Similarly, the Proposed Amendment’s stated goal of adjusting the reporting threshold so that it “reflect(s) propor- tionally the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million represented in 1975” is misguided. Proposed Amend- ment at 12. Congress assigned no “magic” to the percentage of the U.S. equities market that was represented by the $100 million threshold in 1975 (75%). It simply noted that “[i]nitially, the SEC ha[d] estimated that approximately 300 per- sons—holding about 75% of all institutional equity holdings —would be subject to the reporting provisions of the bill.” Senate Report at 264. Again, this percentage was specified only in the context of initial implementation. Upon enactment of Section 13(f ), the Commission had authority to decrease the threshold by 90%, “[i]f the SEC should determine that the public interest would be better served by bringing into the program certain smaller institutional investment managers.” Id. 54 See generally WLRK Section 13 Petition. 55 See National Investor Relations Institute, The Case for 13F Reform at 1 (Sept. 25, 2019), https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy /NIRI -Case -for-13F-Reform -2019 -final.pdf (“NIRI Letter”); NYSE Euronext, Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (2013), https://www.sec.gov/r ules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf (“NYSE Petition”). -14- Reduce 13F and 13D Reporting Windows The reporting windows under the Rules 13f and 13d are too long, rendering much of the data useless when finally revealed to the public. The same technological advancements that have substantially reduced the cost and burden of filing, have also enabled investment man- agers to quickly change th eir positions. Thus, by the time the Commission and the public get their hands on the Form 13F and Schedule 13D data, it is likely stale. “In today’s world, ten days [, and certainly forty -five days,] is an eternity.”56 This information lag handicap s the data’s users and is incompatible with the underlying transparency goals of the Section 13 disclosure programs. Importantly , shorter timeframes for reporting beneficial ownership are common- place in highly successful market econo mies outside the United States, which demonstrates that a shorter window is indeed workable.57 Maintaining outdated and slow disclosure timeframes sub- jects the U.S. markets to disproportionate (as compared to other jurisdictions) risk of ill -informed market decisions, market man ipulation and abusive tactics. Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission shorten the Schedule 13D filing window from ten days to one day and the Form 13F filing window from 45 days to two days. In the case of Schedule 13D, acquirers should be prohibi ted from acquiring beneficial ownership of any additional equity securities of the issuer from the time they cross the 5% threshold until two days after filing on Schedule 13D.58 This brief “cooling -off” period would allow the investing public to assess an d react to the potential market impact of the Schedule 13D disclosures.59 Broaden Definition of “Beneficial Ownership” under Section 13 Under the current Sections 13(f) and 13(d) reporting regimes, “beneficial owner- ship” is comprised of only those securities over which the investor has voting power or invest- ment discretion. Derivatives and other synthetic instruments are not captured by t his definition. The prevalence of these instruments has increased since the enactment of Sections 13(f) and 56 WLRK Section 13 Petition at 3. 57 See Adam Emmerich and William Savitt, Synthetic Ownership Arrangements for Ambush Equity Accumulation (Nov. 27, 2010), https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/11/27/synthetic -ownership -arrangements -for-ambush -equity -accu- mulation/ . 58 Requiring cease tradin g at 5% until there is public disclosure and time for the market to absorb that information best fulfills the original purpose of Section 13(d), and would bring the U.S. in to the 21st Century with nations like Sweden, Australia and Hong Kong, all of which require public disclosure promptly upon the acquisition of 5%, with some nations like the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany even requiring disclosure at a lower 3% level. Notably, however, the use of an even lower 3% early warning level in many EU n ations, with a requirement for immediate reporting and regular updating, has not kept activist investing from increasing markedly, thus undermining any suggestion that requiring real time reporting at 5% would inhibit the ability of hedge funds to influenc e public companies.

These mechanisms can enable investors to attain and exercise voting power and invest- ment discretion over a company’s securities without pos sessing legal ownership of such securi- ties. The narrow definition of “beneficial ownership” advantages sophisticated institu- tional investors to the detriment of other market participants.60 Specifically, it provides investors with yet another easily manipulable mechanism to circumvent statutorily required disclosures and to improperly exert control over corporations, oftentimes leading to market , management and business disruption. We have long cautioned against the hazards posed by the secret accu- mulation of derivatives and the resulting harm to the transparency of the securities markets, cor- porate democracy and the interest of corporate issuers (and their shareholders) in accessing accu- rate information about their shareholder base and its holdings.61 To guard against such dangers, the definition of “beneficial ownership” should be broadened to reflect the realities of the modern securities market and the extent to which power and discretion is no longer exclusively vested in equity securities h olders. Specifically, in the context of Section 13, beneficial ownership should include “ownership of any derivative instru- ment which includes the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit de- rived from any increase in the value of the subject security.”62 This change is appropriate and necessary. Others have similarly called for common -sense changes to the beneficial ownership definition.63 Moreover, many leading market economies, such as the United Kingdom,64 Ger- many,65 Switzerl and,66 Australia67 and Hong Kong68 have broadened their definition of benefi- cial ownership to include a range of derivative instruments. Indeed, Congress itself has indicated its intent to bolster market transparency by requiring the Commission to establish disclosure rules for short -sale activity.69 It is time for the Commission’s rules to catch up with longstanding market devel- opments and to make sure that the U.S. does not continue to lag behind its economic competitors by having an outdated approach t o a new century’s marketplace.70 60 See Theodore N.

Any such review should consider all relevant empirical evidence bearing on the question, including report- ing percentages and other information from other market economies, including those that now use 3% as their baseline reporting threshold. -16- Consideration of A Measured Increas e In the Reporting Threshold Within the context of a comprehensive modernization of the Section 13 disclosure regimes , the Commission coul d and likely should consider a responsibly tailored increas e to the Section 13(f) reporting threshold. Any increase should be carefully measured to fulfill the pur- pose of Section 13(f), while avoiding unnecessary burden to any given market participant . By way of example, if the Commission were to adjust the original Section 13(f) threshold by infla- tion since 1975 , then that would have the effect of limiting any burden of Section 13(f) to smaller investors whose investments are not likely to have a material influence on companies or markets , while continuing to have Section 13(f) filings be a meaningful source of i mportant market infor- mation.71 But even within the context of comprehensive reform, increasing the Form 13F thresh- old by 35 fold, to $3.5 billion, would be excessive and inadvisable.72 Conc lusion We commend the Commission for turning it s attention to the share ownership re- porting regime , and agree that it urgently requires improvement. The Proposed Amendment , however , would not address the deficiencies of the ownership disclosure system but have the op- posite effect. By reducing by 90% the number of Form 13F reporting filers, the Proposed Amendment would further diminish transparency in the securities market and increase the risk of manipulative tactic s by sophisticated investors , thus seriously threatening investor confidence in the integrity of the securities markets. 71 In determining the new threshold under the Proposed Amendment, the Commission applied the growth percentage of the stock market’s value from 1975 to 2018, 3,750%, to the current Section 13(f) threshold, $100 million, and rounded down from $3.57 billion. The Commission appeared to take for granted that the percentage of investment managers subject to Section 13(f) after the Proposed Amendment should remain consistent with the corresponding percentage from 1975 — 75%. A more reasonable approach is the one the Inspector General’s Office and others have used in this context: adjust the threshold consistent with the consumer p rice index inflation, resulting in a $450 million Rule 13f reporting threshold. That type of threshold might make sense in the context of the overall reform of the Section 13 rule regime that we have described. 72 We also note that, as is the case with fi lings under Form 13F, filings under the Hart -Scott -Rodino Antitrust Improve- ments Act of 1976 , as amended (“HSR”) , have come to function as part of the early warning system for issuers. There is an element of perversity in that an antitrust filing may be t he first notice to an issuer that a party is acquiring a stake in the company . As Commissioner Phillips noted in his concurring statement on a recent proposed Federal Trade Commission rules change , the HSR Act “ is not supposed to be an early -warning system for tender offers and corporate takeovers —for that we have a number of laws at the federal and state level. And it is not supposed to be a monitoring system for equity investments generally. To the extent possible, it should not be any of those thin gs. It should effectuate its purpose: helping the Agencies spot transactions likely to violate the antitrust laws, so that we can stop or remedy them prophylactically.” Noah Joshua Phillips, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Hart -Scott -Rodino Ac t Premerger Notifica- tion Notice of Proposed Rulemaking & Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Sept. 18, 2020), https://www.ftc.go v/system/files/documents/public_statements/1580699/p110014hsrrulesphillipsstatement_0.pdf . But because Rule 13(d) allows filers to continue to acquire above the five percent reporting threshold for many days before reporting, and because it is easier than ever for a sophisticated investor to acquire huge bloc ks of stock quickly, the HSR filing, at the low $94 million threshold, sometimes acts as the first signal to a public company that an activist is acquirin g shares in its stock. 15 U.S.C. § 18a. Given recent proposed rulemaking by the Federal Trade Commission (that we expect to become final before year -end) to exempt most acquisitions of less than 10% of an issuer’s outstanding voting securities, however, we do not expect the HSR Act to serve such a si gnificant function going forward.

We believe that the current proposal conflicts with the commission’s duty to uphold transparency by placing the concerns of a subset of asset managers ahead of other market participants, particularly individual investors, who would lose an important, publicly available research tool. Instead, we suggest that the commission withdraw its current proposal and convene a public roundtable to consider the opinions of all market participants. 13F Reporting Requirements Need to be Modernized, not Eliminated We agree with the commission that ownership disclosure rules need modernization; however, the proposed rule would dramatically reduce market transparency. The draft rule would allow 89% of current 13F filers to cease reporting, which would eliminate useful information about investment strategies and holding periods of the more than 4,500 firms managing assets below the $3.5 billion threshold. We believe that an inflation-based increase in the filing threshold would be reasonable and would also be consistent with the incremental approach used by the commission when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,1 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and exit large accelerated filer status,2 and the proposed updates 1 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33-10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-16 (March 31, 2017). 2 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-19 (March 12, 2020). (The SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20% to $60 million from $50 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12% to $560 million from $500 million.) 2 to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.3 Moreover, the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General 2010 Review of Section 13F Reporting Requirements suggested raising the threshold to $300 million4 in accordance with inflation using the Consumer Price Index. We believe that is an appropriate adjustment, rather than the tenfold increase the SEC is proposing. Market transparency increases market efficiency, which ultimately lowers costs for all investors. To that end, we support 13F modernization, including recent proposals by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.5 These include transparency-boosting elements, such as the reduction of an outdated 45-day reporting period, as well as the inclusion of short positions and other types of securities like derivatives. Morningstar also believes that it would be useful to report aggregate purchases and sales activity during the reporting period in addition to quarter-end positions, as this method is more transparent than the dated snapshot provided by the current reporting method. Finally, to enhance the usability of the 13F data, Morningstar believes that the form should include the full company legal name as well as other identifying information such as a central index key and legal entity identifier and other company-related information like domiciles and business addresses. Finally, we believe the 13F should provide information on each beneficial owner. Raising the Threshold Places Asset Managers Ahead of Individual Investors An analysis of 13F filing data conducted by Morningstar reveals that, in the first quarter of 2020, institutional investment managers filing Form 13F reported holdings in 7,224 listed equity issues. For 62% (4,478) of these issues, institutional holdings are sufficiently high that an investor would need to contact only one holder to communicate with at least 3% of the corporation’s equity ownership. Upon raising the threshold to $3.5 billion, this percentage would drop to 53%. 3 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, File No: S7- 23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019). (The commission proposed to increase the minimum holding requirement for shareholder resolutions to $25,000 from $2,000 but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company’s shares for at least three years.) 4 https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf 5 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-659 (Feb. 1, 2013), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689 (Oct. 7, 2015), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691 (Dec. 7, 2015), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-691.pdf . 3 Morningstar has a rich history of advocacy on behalf of individual investors, and we believe that the current proposal places the needs of a subset of asset management firms ahead of individual investors’ needs. 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information freely available to individual investors. The filings surface investment ideas for individual investors who perform their own investment selection, but they can also help individual investors research asset managers they might like to hire. As such, the proposal deprives individual investors of an important tool used to hold the asset management industry to account. Concealing Hedge Fund Involvement Favors Short-Term Thinking Over Long-Term Investing The proposal would likely expose more U.S. public companies to hedge fund activism, placing short-term thinking ahead of longer-term-oriented investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched,6 and it is reasonable to expect that many activist investors took advantage of share price declines in early 2020 to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. According to IHS Markit, 86% of activist investors would no longer have to make 13F filings should this proposal go into effect. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, these activist investors could conceal their positions to their benefit, catching long-term-oriented institutional and individual investors by surprise should activist involvement later lead to increased volatility in these positions. For these reasons, we request that the commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments. Very truly yours, Aron Szapiro, Head of Policy Research Morningstar, Inc.

Investors have become more active in engaging with issuers on many important matters, including capital allocation decisions, long -term strategy, M&A, and ESG risks and opportunities . In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors.

At most companies , the volume of requests far exceeds the scarce executive (or director) time available for such engagement, so IR professionals have to help decide which investors should have priority. To make these determinations, m ost U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings , the only accurate source available .4 The Commission’s propo sed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust engagement by U.S. companies by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include a number of well -known hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) sec urities on a long -term basis.5 While companies would continue to receive information from the largest inv estors, many of th ose institutions are passive , indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 3 Congres s has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure . Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short position s, while Section 951 mandated annual disclos ure of proxy votes on executive compensation . 4 Unfortunately , companies cannot always accept investors’ representations at face value. In a 201 8 survey of NIRI members, 45.5 percent of respondents said they definitely had experiences with investors who misrepresented their positions to obtain meetings with C -suite executives, while another 40.5 percent said they suspected that had happened. 5 See, e.g., Bloomberg News (Quint), “Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC Plan,” July 15, 2020, available at https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/tepper -einhorn -soros -stock -holdings -would -go- dark-in-sec-plan. 3 more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is mo re valuable.6 Small and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency . Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds tri ggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surface s with a 5 percent (or more) position .7 The Commission also ha s not fully considered the negative impact of raising the 13F threshold on retail investors and small asset managers , many of whom use 13F data when making investment decisions .8 For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 1 3F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer -investor engagement. We also request that the Commission convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors, and issuers on potential 13F reforms and other market transparency issues, including proposals to address “short and distort” abuses, the repeal of the OBO/NOBO rules, and the modernization of 13D reporting.9 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would inc rease transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation. 6 According to an IHS Markit analy sis of the Russell 3000, an average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list. IHS Markit, ""SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,"" August 7, 2020, available at: https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor - analysis/ . 7 The potential reduction in 13F transparency is especially concerning as market observers expec t a post-pandemic surge in hedge fund activism, similar to what happened after the financial crisis of 2008 -09. See Barron's , ""Hostile Bidders Are Ready to Pounce on Struggling Companies.

Many investors review 13F data before making trading decisions, just as they monitor Form 4 data on stock trades by co rporate insiders. When the Commission reduced the Form 4 reporting period to two business days in 2002 , the SEC touted the benefits of greater ownership transparency: “Making this information available to all investors on a more timely basis should increase market transparency, which will likely enhance market efficiency and liquidity.” Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Release Nos. 34 -46421; 35 -27563; File No. S7 -31-02, August 29, 2002. 9 See Professo rs John C.

Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: The Security Traders Association of New York, Inc. (“STANY”)1 appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed rule published by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) to amend the reporting thresholds for institutional investment managers. The Commission is proposing to update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by raising the threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion. The proposal also would amend Form 13F to increase the information provided by institutional investment managers by eliminating the omission threshold for individual securities and requiring managers to provide additional identifying information. As a professional organization comprised of individuals employed in the securities industry, STANY does not represent a single business or business model, but rather provides a forum for trading professionals representing broker-dealers, market makers, institutions, ATSs, trading centers and technology companies to share their unique perspectives on issues facing the securities markets. Our members perform essential functions in the capital markets ecosystem; an ecosystem that has performed incredibly well and today provides a trading experience for retail investors that has never been better. Our members take great pride in the US equity markets and collectively strive to support regulation and market structure that encourages capital formation, elevates investor confidence, and promotes fairness. We believe that the Proposal is antithetical to these goals and to the Commission’s mission to protect investors, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation. For these and other reasons cited herein, we oppose the proposed changes in reporting thresholds and urge the Commission to withdraw the proposed amendments as it relates to disclosure thresholds. 1 STANY, a membership association representing professionals engaged in the trading of securities since 1937, is committed to be a leading advocate of policies and programs that foster investor trust, professional ethics, and marketplace integrity and that support capital formation, marketplace innovation and education of market participants. 2 Background Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act was adopted by Congress as part of the Securities Act Amendments of 1975. Through quarterly Section 13(f) reporting, the Commission intended to ""create ... a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers, in order to improve the body of factual data available and to facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and public policy implications of that influence.""2 Since its implementation, the Commission has recognized the benefits of Rule 13(f) reporting that inure to both investors and public companies. For example, in 1999, while adopting rules requiring the filing of Form 13F via EDGAR, the Commission noted that “investors would find the information contained in Form 13F filings useful in tracking institutional investor holdings in their investments and . . . issuers . . . would find detail as to institutional investor holdings useful because much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.” 3 As the Commission notes in footnote 28 in the Proposal, throughout the years, there have been industry efforts to amend and modernize 13F reporting requirements. However, unlike the current Proposal, each of those efforts have sought additional disclosures and greater transparency4 , advocating for shortening reporting deadlines, seeking disclosure of short positions, including disclosure of OTC equity positions, and calling for monthly as opposed to quarterly reports. Rather than revisit industry suggestions, the Commission is looking to modernize 13F reports by proposing a thirty-five-fold increase to the threshold for filing from $100 million in U.S. equity assets under management (“EAUM”) to $3.5 billion. As a result of this outsized increase, it is projected that 4,500 investment managers overseeing $2.3 trillion in assets would no longer be required to disclosure their holdings to the public effectively eliminating 13F as a reporting system for most investors, including many activist and event-driven hedge funds. Contrary to industry efforts to improve 13F, STANY believes that increasing reporting thresholds contravenes the objective articulated in the Adopting Release. 2 See Exchange Act Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5, 1979), 44 FR 3033, at 3033-3034 (See also, Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 14852, 43 Fed. Reg. 26700, 26701 (June 22, 1978) (the “Adopting Release”). 3 See Exchange Act Release No. 40934 (Jan. 12, 1999), 64 FR 2843, at p. 2844-45 (the “EDGAR Adopting Release”). 4 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-659.pdf; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-689.pdf.; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-691.pdf. 3 The Commission lacks the statutory authority to reduce the 13F reporting threshold STANY agrees with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee’s plain reading of the Commission’s limitations on amendments to the reporting threshold in the enabling statute. As Commission Lee aptly notes, Congress established a salutatory reporting threshold of $100 million in EAUM while setting specific limits on the Commission’s authority to lower but not increase that threshold. The relevant text of section 13(f)(1) of the statute provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter.5 (emphasis added) Commissioner Lee’s analysis of the legislative history of the Act is unerring and we agree with her that the Proposal has glossed over those Congressionally mandated limits. We likewise agree that the Commission’s use of its exemptive authority to increase the reporting threshold would, “vitiate the limit that Congress placed on [its] authority to rewrite the statute to reflect the opposite meaning from its plain language.” 6 The Proposal contravenes the stated purposes of Congress in adopting Section 13(f) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 7 The Proposal would eliminate filings from over 90% of investment managers currently required to file 13F reports severely curtailing the Congressional goal of creating a “central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers.” Although the Commission notes that other reporting avenues, such as N-PORT, which requires monthly reporting by investment companies, are available to follow the activities of investment managers, small investment managers who are not required to be registered with the Commission may no longer be required to publicly report their investment activities. Likewise, the objective of “facilitat[ing] consideration of the influence and impact of institutional 5 See Section 13(f)(1) 6 See Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, U.S. SEC. & EXCH. COMM’N (July 10, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10 7 See Release at 7 n.10, 8 n.19 (citing 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1)); see also Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 14852, 43 Fed. Reg. 26700, 26701 (June 22, 1978) (the “Adopting Release”). 4 investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence” will be severally hampered by eliminating reporting by a swath of investment managers. The Commission’s decision to raise the threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion based on a comparison of total equity values in 1975 and today does not take into consideration changes in investment practices during this period and the importance of small and mid-size investment managers to trading in small and mid-cap companies. With the proposed changes, it may become impossible to determine the impact of institutional investment managers on significant segments of the market specifically small and mid-cap companies. Frontrunning and copying are not concerns that need to be addressed through changes in reporting thresholds The claims of frontrunning and copying do not justify changing the reporting thresholds. Firstly, there is an absence of evidence offered in the Proposal for the assertion that frontrunning and copying are concerns that could be mitigated by the amendments to 13F. Secondly, since investment managers have 45 days after a quarter ends to submit 13F reports to the Commission, the filings provide a snapshot rather than a true depiction of fund managers’ portfolio holdings or investment strategy mooting concerns with front running and copying. Moreover, as 13F filings do not include non-US traded equities, short positions or OTC equities, or specify the prices at which securities were purchased, they offer at best a partial look at an overall investment strategy. Moreover, if frontrunning were a legitimate concern, that concern should apply equally to accounts with more than $3.5 billion under management. While it is easier to rationalize copying than frontrunning, anyone copying investment strategies based on a 13F filing position would be buying and selling after the investment management firm which would not negatively impact the investments. On the contrary, buying positions that are already held by investment managers would tend to increase demand and market prices for those positions. While we appreciate that copying and frontrunning may become issues if the Commission were to radically change the reporting deadlines, or increase the frequency of reports, under current 13F reporting requirements, neither is an issue. These vague concerns certainly do not justify an erosion of transparency. The modest costs of reporting by investment managers are outweighed by the benefits of transparency STANY and its members are generally grateful for measure by the Commission aimed at cost savings for the industry and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts to lessen the expense and regulatory burdens for small funds. However, we do not believe that there has been an adequate cost benefit analysis of reporting under 13F to justify the Proposal. Likewise, we are concerned that the negative consequences of the Proposal would in the end far outweigh the intended benefits. Reference to private meetings with “small investment managers” notwithstanding, the Commission has failed to provide evidence that current reporting is an undue burden. While the Commission continues to add costs of disclosure across other areas of the industry, we question why the Commission is concerned about money managers–some of the wealthiest investors–saving thousands of dollars. The rule change 5 would not impact only smaller investment managers who purportedly bear some loosely identified burden occasioned by filing, but would exempt some of the world’s wealthiest billionaire investors and large hedge funds 8, all of whom oversee billions of dollars of investments but nevertheless fall below the $3.5 billion threshold. Rather than conducting an economic analysis, which it is required to do under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act,9 the Commission has relied on Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) estimates of the costs of compliance with current 13F reporting requirements by investment managers with EAUM of less than $3.5 billion. As noted by Commissioner Lee, those calculations are troubling. Firstly, the calculations used in justifying the need for changes in the reporting threshold are inconsistent with the Commission’s recent and historic estimates of costs of reporting. Secondly, the Commission’s estimated hourly costs of filing likely overestimates costs of reporting by using standard and equal estimate of compliance, attorney and coding time. It is our understanding that for the majority of firms, the process of quarterly reporting is simple and automated. Even for those mangers who prepare 13F forms manually, the Commissions estimates annual costs benefits of the Proposal (using the problematic cost analysis in the PRA) amount to annual savings of approximately $15,000-$30,000 per “smaller” manager. We do not believe that this relatively modest (and likely even smaller) financial burden justifies damage to transparency that would be occasioned by the rule change. Burden on the Commission staff can be mitigated in other ways With the increase in the number of investment managers subject to 13F reporting, STANY does not dispute that the Commission staff manages more inquiries surrounding the completion of Form 13F filings now than they did when the rule was initially instituted. However, we believe that the majority of inquiries concern mechanics related to filling out forms and delivering reports to the Commission. With additional information from the Commission on the types of inquiries that it receives, perhaps an industry solution can be offered for streamlining reporting or otherwise minimizing staff time while preserving the transparency afforded by 13F reporting. The Proposal will disproportionately impact small companies and thinly traded securities We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the effects on secondary trading of these thinly traded securities “or balance[d] the interests of issuers, and particularly small issuers, against the population of institutional investment managers affected by this proposal..."" 10 Shares of small to mid-size companies, many of which are thinly traded, are disproportionately held by small to mid-size 8 See, Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC Plan 2020-07-14 19:01:34.266 GMT by Miles Weiss, Ben Bain and Hema Parmar (Bloomberg) 9 See National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-290, § 106(b) (Oct. 11, 1996) 10 See Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, U.S. SEC. & EXCH. COMM’N (July 10, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10 6 investment managers and small to mid-size broker dealers disproportionately provide execution and investment services for these securities. Small companies are more likely to use 13F reports to locate investors interested in their sectors and in other companies with similar profiles and use this information to target potential new investors. Thinly traded securities are also more likely to be held by individual investors who purchase securities through self-directed vehicles without the aid of an investment advisor. To the extent that these individual investors have access to information about professional managers’ investment decisions (again after the fact) they are likely to have more confidence about making an investment. Recently, IHS Markit analyzed the Russell 3000–the 3000 largest companies in the United States–to identify which issuers and investors would be affected most by the change in reporting thresholds and found that market capitalization played a significant role in the impact of the Proposal. IHS Markit concluded that “mega cap (4.4%) and large cap (5.5%) companies would only lose insight into about 1/20th of their total shares outstanding. However, small cap (14.6%) and micro-cap (17.1%) companies would lose insight into roughly three times more shares.” 11 The disproportionate loss of transparency into ownership of shares of smaller capitalized firms will hinder their ability to both proactively and passively attract new investment from investors in similar companies. It will be harder for broker dealers to source and enhance liquidity in thinly traded securities without information provided in 13F reports The ability of small to mid-size broker dealers to provide enhanced liquidity to investors in the secondary markets will also be adversely impacted by the proposed changes in 13F thresholds. Through capital commitment, secondary offerings, and institutional block trades, broker dealers often facilitate liquidity beyond that which is publicly displayed. Currently 13F filings provide shareholder ownership information that informs decisions by broker dealers. Absent this information, we anticipate that broker dealers will be less inclined to commit capital. Likewise, broker dealers acting in agency capacities facilitating orders on behalf of clients use 13F filing information to find counterparties. With less transparency–especially in thinly traded securities–broker dealers would need to acquire information about counter parties elsewhere, such as from third-party vendors. Not only will sourcing this information add additional costs to transactions, but there is a likelihood that information sourced through other avenues would be inferior to that which is currently available through 13F reports. The Proposal will negatively impact the ability of companies to interact with their shareholders Listed companies rely on 13F filings as the only accurate source of ownership information of their equity shares. Monitoring their investor base is a fundamental and critical activity of public companies and the diminution of transparency into ownership occasioned by the proposed changes will impair the ability of 11 See IHS Markit SEC’s 13F Proposal–Issuer and Investor Analysis, August 7, 2020 https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/secs-13f-proposal--issuer-and-investor-analysis.html 7 public companies to identify and engage effectively with their most active investors, and to gage the efficacy of their investor relations efforts. As a result, communications between issuers and investors would be adversely impacted. Public companies and their investor relations departments also use 13F data to determine which institutions are increasing or decreasing their holdings so that they may properly allocate scarce C-suite time among investors. Again, smaller companies will be more greatly impacted by the Proposal as they tend to have limited resources and consequently a greater need to allocate IR department time efficiently. Lack of transparency may open companies to stealth activist attacks Form 13F reports are the primary source through which investors, companies, and other market participants first learn or verify that an activist hedge fund is accumulating or has accumulated a significant (but less than 5%) position in a target company’s stock. Generally activist attacks come from firms that hold less than $3.5 billion in assets. Consequently, raising the 13F reporting thresholds will make it significantly more difficult to determine whether an activist, or group of activists, owns a stake in a company. Of great concern is IHS Markit’s finding that, were the Proposal to be enacted, 86% of activist investors would no longer be required to file 13F reports.12 The Proposal erodes investor confidence One of the stated objectives of Congress in adopting 13F was “to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.”13 We are concerned that not only will the diminution of transparency contemplated by the Proposal damage confidence, but that the Proposal itself seems to have created trepidation amongst investors about the integrity of the markets. Investor confidence can be fragile as evidenced by the plethora of comments by retail investors who view the Commission’s plan to amend 13F thresholds as a way to “rig the markets” in favor of some of its largest players. These letters and emails highlight the instability of investor confidence and suggest that the Proposal confirms a belief that the markets are stacked in favor of institutional investors, market makers, and other securities professionals. STANY is confident they the markets are not only not rigged, but that they are performing better than ever for retail investors. However, transparency provided by 13F filings helps to maintain market integrity. Although smaller institutional investors may have sought relief from the Commission, the Proposal does not reflect advocacy by the industry as a whole. Our members, professionals on both the buy and sell side of the markets, overwhelmingly favor transparency and oppose the changes to the reporting threshold reflected in the Proposal. However, we wish to note that such a significant elevation in the reporting threshold contemplated by the 12 See IHS Markit SEC’s 13F Proposal–Issuer and Investor Analysis, August 7, 2020 https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/secs-13f-proposal--issuer-and-investor-analysis.html 13 See Release at 9 n.20 (citing Adopting Release, 43 Fed. Reg. at 26701, 26701 n.4). 8 Commission may actually give larger fund managers an incentive to take advantage of the system. It would be easy for investment managers who wish to avoid disclosure to wait until quarter -end and sell securities to fall below the reporting threshold or enter into derivatives transactions that do not count toward the $3.5 billion level . This could eviscerate the intention behind 13F reporting and erode investor confidence . Elimination of Exception s and Expansion of 13F Securities to Include OTC Securities Although we oppose the Commission’s proposal to change the reporting thresholds as outlined in the Release , we support the elimination of exceptions to reporting. Eliminating exceptions is consistent with our position taken in 2013 at which time STANY suggested that the Commission expand the scope of 13(f) reporting to all OTC equity securities with a FINRA sy mbol14. The principles which led Congress to adopt Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act mandating managers’ disclosures of holdings in “13(f) securities” apply equally to managers’ holding in securities of companies traded on the OTC Markets. The creation at th e Commission of a central repository of historical and current data about investment activities of institutional investment managers in OTC equity securities would be valuable to the investing public as well as to issuers of those securities. Summary We thank the Commission for the opportunity to provide comments on the Proposal. We agree with Commissioner Lee that reducing the reporting threshold for 13F reports is inconsistent with the Commission’s statutory authority and contravenes Congressional inten t. Moreover, w hile we appreciate the Commission’s goal to reduce costs and burdens on investment managers, the unintended consequences of a drastic reduction in the reporting threshold far outweigh the intended benefits. Access to quarterly ownership infor mation provided by 13F reports is vital for public companies and their ability to engage with shareholders and attract additional investors. C apital formation, secondary trading especially in small and mid-cap companies, and investor confidence would all suffer as a result of increasing the reporting threshold as provided in the Proposal. STANY respectfully requests that the Commission withdraw the Proposal. As always, our members would be happy to work with the Commission on industry solutions to modernize 13F reporting while maintaining transparency and the integrity of the markets. Please feel free to contact the undersigned with any questions.

The common stock of CVS Health is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE trading symbol: CVS). As a public company CVS Health has filed reports with the U.S. S ecurities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”) since the Company was formed in 1996. CVS Health appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules issued by the Commission on July 10, 2020, entitled Reporting Threshold for Institu tional Investment Managers. CVS Health understands the Commission’s desire to update the thresholds that require institutional investment managers to report their holdings on Form 13F (the “Proposal”). For the reasons identified below, however, the Compan y urges the Commission to table this effort until it can more broadly address the need for greater transparency in the proxy system. CVS Health believes that the Proposal would reduce information available to the public about the identity of the institutio nal holders of our common shares. (At CVS Health, approximately 85% of our common stock is held by institutions.) We believe that the reduction in transparency that would result from the Proposal would greatly hamper our efforts to engage with our stockh olders, at a time when issuers, stockholders and policymakers have reached consensus about the critical importance of stockholder engagement. A successful stockholder engagement program requires us to be able to identify our stockholders, but few sources o f this information currently exist. CVS Health regularly utilizes Form 13F filings to identify, and facilitate meaningful engagement with, a significant number of its stockholders. In recent years CVS Health has attempted engagement with holders of over 50% of our common stock. The Company believes that amending the Form 13F threshold would impair stockholder engagement by triggering a substantial loss of market transparency. As 13F filings serve as the single source of information regarding which “stree t name” investors are buying and selling stock each quarter, CVS Health is particularly concerned that the Proposal will impair our ability to identify our stockholders, particularly at smaller to medium -sized firms.

We are writing to express our strong opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. The SEC’s proposed Form 13F threshold will result in significant information loss for investors and issuers The SEC adopted Form 13F in 1978 to gauge the impact of large institutional money managers on the securities markets. However, as with many business and regulatory decisions, there are often secondary and tertiary effects and uses that may not become evident until much later. In the case of Form 13Fs, the filings have long come to be used by corporate equity issuers to understand their investor bases and for investor targeting. A data-driven process for matching of investors and issuers is critical in ensuring efficiency in capital formation and allocation. Data from Form 13F filings allow issuers and intermediaries to optimize their targeting processes rather than flying blind. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Fintuitive LLC 26 Park Street, Suite 2025 | Montclair, NJ 07042 www.fintuitive.com The proposed increase in Form 13F filing threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion will significantly reduce valuable data and increase friction in these capital formation processes. The expected benefits, if any, are of dubious value. The SEC’s primary argument is that the information loss will be minimal. Our analysis indicates that this is not the case1. For example, according to our analysis of 5,262 Form 13F filings for the period ending March 31, 2020, publicly traded companies with market capitalization less than $500 million will lose visibility into 30% of their current shareholders. When only top-50 shareholders are considered, 29% of the top-50 shareholders are lost. Data for different market capitalization buckets is provided charts below. Ironically, the impact of the new threshold will be felt disproportionately by small-cap and mid-cap issuers, precisely the areas where capital markets are less efficient and information more scarce. The difference between small and large corporate issuers is even more stark when considering information on top-50 shareholders. The information loss is further compounded when you consider that companies are not only losing information on their own shareholders/investors, but also investors in their industries and peer companies. In reducing the burden on managers with billions of dollars under management, the SEC will effectively impose a different kind of burden on smaller corporate equities issuers. 1. SEC's Proposed Form 13F Threshold Is Misguided, August 11, 2020, available at: https://www.fintuitive.com/insights/impact-of-sec-form-13f-filing-threshold-on-shareholders-and-ownership _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Fintuitive LLC 26 Park Street, Suite 2025 | Montclair, NJ 07042 www.fintuitive.com Newer filing requirements will not compensate for information loss in Form 13Fs The SEC then argues that newer reporting requirements such as N-PORT provide additional data that might compensate for data lost with a higher Form 13F reporting threshold. However, many of the funds getting relief under the higher Form 13F reporting threshold are not required to file N-PORTs. Therefore, the idea that N-PORTs might compensate for information lost due to a higher threshold for 13Fs is misguided. A list of select Form 13F filers that would be relieved from filing under the new threshold AND are also not N-PORT filers is given below. The list includes well-established names and hardly the ones that would come to mind deserving of relief from incurring the relatively minor expense of a relatively uncomplicated quarterly filing. Neither front-running, nor copycatting appear to be valid issues Finally, the SEC argues that smaller managers might face indirect costs from potential front-running and copycatting. This argument does not stand up to scrutiny either. The deadline for filing Form 13Fs is 45 days from the end of the quarter. It is hard to imagine any kind of front-running that might be possible with information that is between 45 and 135 days stale (for hypothetical trades executed at the beginning of the quarter or end of the quarter and reported 45 days after the end of the quarter). _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Fintuitive LLC 26 Park Street, Suite 2025 | Montclair, NJ 07042 www.fintuitive.com Going past mere common-sense logic, we find that data are also contrary to the SEC’s argument. A total of 5,262 final Form 13Fs (excluding 13F-NTs and filings later amended) were filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2020. Of these, 2,351 or 44% were filed at least one week prior to the regulatory deadline. If either front-running or copycatting were issues for these filers, one would have expected them to file on the last possible day. This is clearly not the case. When we look further at the size of the reported portfolio, we see that of these 2,351 “early filers,” 2,197 or 93% were managers that would get relief under the new threshold. Even if we accept that front-running or copycatting are valid issues for money managers, data show that it not considered an important issue by the very managers to whom relief is being given. Besides, professional investment managers of active mutual funds also have quarterly portfolio reporting requirements. The problem of front-running and/or copycatting does not appear to have been to the detriment of either investors in these funds or their managers. And when portfolios of larger, more influential investment managers are available, why would front-runners or copycatters focus on managers that the SEC is basically labeling as irrelevant to the proper functioning of markets? _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Fintuitive LLC 26 Park Street, Suite 2025 | Montclair, NJ 07042 www.fintuitive.com Smaller, active investors are as important to markets as larger, passive investors Probably the most significant difference between when the SEC initially implemented the rule in 1975 and now is the prevalence of index investors or passive managers. Many of the largest money managers today (Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, etc.) comprise mostly passive investing funds. If the SEC is looking for data that will help it in maintaining orderly markets, it cannot ignore active managers whose decisions are based on price and othe r investment characteristics rather than just membership in an index. Many of these active managers will fall below the SEC's proposed $3.5 billion threshold. Conclusion We consider the SEC's proposal ill-advised and encourage the SEC to reverse its proposal . Fintuitive appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Commission’s Proposed Rule. We would be pleased to provide any further information or respond to any questions that the Commission or the staff may have. Sincerely, Rohit Sood President"
"Tom Quaadman, Executive Vice President, Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, U.S. Chamber of Commerce",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860072-223915.pdf,,"September 29, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290, File Number S7-08-20 Dear Secretary Countryman: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (“CCMC”) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) proposed rule (“Proposal”) to update the threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers (“IIMs”). Under current rules, an IIM must complete Form 13F if they exercise investment discretion over 13(f) securities – as defined under the Exchange Act – of more than $100 million in aggregate fair market value. While the Chamber shares the desire to review and update existing regulation, we must oppose the Proposal, which would increase the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion. We are concerned that a change in the reporting threshold would significantly reduce transparency and inhibit communication between companies and their investors. Background According to the Proposal, Form 13F was adopted to address “certain gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors.”1 Moreover, three goals were established for the Form 13F disclosure program: (1) the creation of a central repository of historical and current data about investment activities of IIMs; (2) improving data available regarding 1 Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20, page 8. https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 2 holdings of IIMs; and (3) increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. security markets.2 The Proposal further recognizes that the usefulness of Form 13F data has expanded beyond the original intent, which was for regulators and the public to better understand “the effects of institutional equity ownership on the markets.”3 Today, a wide variety of market participants, researchers, academics, and investors, among others, rely on Form 13F data. Importance of Form 13F Transparency to Market Participants CCMC’s mission is to advance America’s global leadership in capital formation by supporting diverse capital markets that are the most fair, transparent, efficient, and innovative in the world. Just recently in July, we commended the SEC for finalizing its reforms to proxy advisory firms. We specifically cited, among other benefits, a greater promotion of transparency as a result of the final rule. As the SEC reports in the Proposal, today more than 5,000 managers file Form 13F reports. However, the number of 13F filers would plummet to 550 with a threshold increase to $3.5 billion. This means that equity ownership data from approximately 89 percent of current Form 13F filers would be lost to both investors and companies. Accordingly, CCMC is deeply concerned about this Proposal’s impact on institutional equity ownership transparency for corporations, market participants, and investors. CCMC urges the SEC against modifying the Form 13F threshold as it would lead to less transparency to the detriment of the U.S. capital markets. Form 13F is an integral tool by which corporations, investors, and other market participants can track equity ownership by institutional investors. Moreover, the data derived from Form 13F quarterly reporting is the only accurate means to track equity ownership by institutional investors. Corporations utilize Form 13F data to monitor on a quarterly basis who is buying and selling their shares. By tracking ownership of their shareholders, businesses can gain important insights into trading patterns, institutional ownership composition, and stock volatility. Among the insights sought, for example, a company will want to understand the distribution of its investors. Whether they are growth or value 2 Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20, page 9. 3 Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20, page 22. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 3 investors, for instance, will help inform a corporation about the appeal of a company’s investment story. Furthermore, the volume and timing of stock transactions have implications for both corporations and investors about stock volatility. Corporations will seek to evaluate whether there is high turnover of the holding, or if investors are transacting as part of a short- or long-term strategy. Such data is also important in enabling corporations to determine if activist investors are accumulating positions. Through these various insights, corporations are then able to effectively engage and share this important intelligence with their shareholders and determine ways to improve upon their outreach to shareholders and potential investors. Form 13F data also helps investment managers in managing assets. For example, the data allows for the efficient and confidential targeting of investors, such as for IPO testing the waters meetings. The filings also allow brokers to better allocate transactions to long-term investors, as holdings can be monitored after capital markets transactions. The data from Form 13F reports is equally important to shareholders as they assess their return on investment and investment strategy. Investors benefit from the information conveyed by Form 13F reports about their equity holdings. The communication that occurs between a shareholder and a corporation and/or investment manager is vital in enabling investors to make informed and confident decisions. Potential Consequences of Less Transparency The Proposal would reduce the level of decision-useful information in the stock market. The loss of this important data would have numerous detrimental consequences to the stakeholders who value this information. We believe that instead of adopting these changes to 13F the SEC should continue to embrace principles of transparency that have guided its recent rulemakings on proxy advisory firms and shareholder proposals. First, reduced visibility into stock ownership could invite threats from activist investors. A recent report found that 86 percent of activist investors would no longer be required to file Form 13F reports.4 Although the SEC believes that the new threshold would provide meaningful relief for small IIMs, many of what the SEC 4 IHS Markit, SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis, https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/secs-13f- proposal--issuer-and-investor-analysis.html Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 4 considers smaller investment managers can nonetheless hold meaningful positions in companies. By allowing activist investors to avoid Form 13F reporting, a corporation may not become aware of a threat until it is too late to act in defense. Second, a reduction in transparency may negatively impact meaningful investor communications. Should this Proposal move forward, we are concerned that a corporation’s communications to its shareholders would be less effective. Corporations and other financial stakeholders, such as asset managers and brokers, would be hampered and seriously challenged in communicating key information to investors about institutional holdings. Additionally, corporations would be challenged in most effectively managing competing investor requests for engagement of Investor Relations Officers (IROs), the C-suite, and directors. Companies would also be less able to discern the objectives of certain shareholders that may be accumulating large positions. With less Form 13F information available, many corporations and other financial stakeholders would need to hire or develop additional resources to be able to maintain an effective dialogue with investors. Third, CCMC is concerned about the potential impact of this Proposal to the capital markets. For example, we expect an increased risk of market signaling to the largest investors that can piece together a mosaic when multiple brokers are seeking feedback and competing for specific opportunities. It is clear from these potential consequences that the Proposal does not meet the goals established by the SEC in creating Form 13F. A decrease of almost 90 percent of Form 13F reporting neither supports the concept of a central repository of data nor does it improve the body of data regarding holdings of IIMs. In addition, the loss of vital data and associated consequences to investor communications, capital markets, and activist investors would weaken investor confidence. CCMC also questions whether other sources can replace the data that would be lost by the proposed threshold change to Form 13F reporting. The Proposal asserts that “alternative sources of holdings data…either exist or are being developed and may provide overlapping or similar data to that included on Form 13F,”5 citing N-PORT and the consolidated audit trail (“CAT”) as examples. However, the data derived from the Form 13F quarterly reporting is currently the only accurate means to track equity ownership by institutional investors. The Form 13F stream of data cannot be replicated using N-PORT since its universe of filers is much smaller than the universe 5 Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20, page 24. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 5 of Form 13F filers. Further, the CAT is a repository of data that doesn’t fully exist; however, even if it does become fully operational, that data would only be available to the SEC and self-regulatory organizations for analysis. Conclusion We thank you for your consideration of these comments and would be happy to discuss these issues further. Sincerely, Tom Quaadman"

Countryman, Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F. Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Commissioner Clayton and Ms. Countryman, The Energy Infrastructure Council (“ EIC”) is a non-profit trade association of companies that develop and operate energy infrastructure, including traditional and renewable energy infrastructure companies, service providers and other businesses and individuals that operate in and around the energy industry. The EIC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“ Commission ” or “SEC”) proposed amendments to Form 13F under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“ Exchange Act ”). While the EIC supports the Commission’s efforts to modernize rules and regulations appropriately in order to promote the efficiency and fairness of the securities markets, we believe that the proposed amendments included in the SEC’s July 10, 2020 proposing release (the “ Proposing Release ”) would significantly reduce the transparency of the markets and undermine a company’s ability to engage directly with their investors. In addition, we believe that while the Commission’s proposed amendments consider the time that has passed since the original threshold was adopted, the amendments do not fully take into account how the markets have structurally changed over time. Given these considerations, and after due deliberation, the EIC respectfully submits this comment letter requesting that the Commission reconsider its proposal. The EIC believes that open and timely communication between companies and their investors is critical to the success of the modern company. Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies with whom they invest. Investors have become more active in engaging with companies on matters of importance to them, and companies have increasingly sought to enhance their disclosures and engage with investors year-round. Many of our EIC members engage with their investors through formal investor outreach and engagement programs that include members of their boards. Because of the complexity of the securities markets and the methods by which investors hold their interests, companies 2 rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings to determine with whom they need to engage. It is our view that the proposed amendments would significantly reduce the transparency of the securities markets, curtailing companies’ understanding of their investor base and engagement with those investors. As described in the Proposing Release, the proposed threshold would eliminate 13F filings for nearly 90% of institutional investment managers. For many companies, particularly smaller companies, the proposed threshold would effectively eliminate much if not all of the usefulness of 13F filings. We are in agreement with Commissioner Lee who suggested in her July 10, 2020 public statement that the cost of losing transparency warrants greater analysis than that included in the Proposing Release and that it is possible that greater transparency, not less, is warranted given the strategic importance for companies, particularly smaller companies, in understanding their investor base. We are also of the view that the Commission’s proposed amendments fail to account for the many ways in which the securities market has become more complex since the Form 13F rules were originally adopted. In that time, the landscape of both passive and active investing has changed significantly, as has the concentration of capital among larger investment managers (which may, nevertheless, hold less than $3.5 billion on a long-term basis) and public companies. We are concerned that the Commission’s reliance on this simplified metric of the change in market size, without considering participant behavior, may have unintended consequences for policymaking in this and other arenas. Finally, we are concerned that effectively limiting Form 13F reporting to passive investors would leave both companies and investors with an incomplete view of the securities market and significantly decrease the overall usefulness of the information. By limiting disclosure to the approximately 550 largest investment managers, many investors, including large investors, whose trading activities have significant repercussions for companies and investors alike would be free from quarterly disclosure obligations. It is our view that this result contravenes both the original purpose of Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act and many of the Commission’s other recent efforts to increase marketplace transparency. For these reasons, we believe the Commission should refocus on previously advanced proposals to implement reforms aimed at improving market transparency and fostering effective engagement between companies and their investors. Specifically, we believe that, rather than significantly reduce 13F transparency, the Commission should withdraw the proposed amendments and consider reducing the current 45-day reporting period, requiring 13F filers to disclose short positions and supporting legislation to provide for monthly disclosure.1 Thank you for considering our comments.

Countryman Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F St NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (File No. S7 -8-20) Secretary Countryman: The Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the above referenced proposed rule (the “Proposal”) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or the “Commission”) concerning rules for fundraising i n private markets. Members of the AFR Education Fund coalition include consumer, civil rights, investor, retiree, community, labor, faith based, and business groups.1 We urge the Commission to reconsider its misguided proposal to raise the reporting thre shold under Form 13F for institutional investment managers . Such a decision would significantly obstruct transparency across publicly traded stocks and contradict the Commission’s stated mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maint ain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. This proposal would raise the Form 13F reporting threshold by an astounding thirty five fold, from $100 million to $3.5 billion in eligible securities . Clearly this represents a very striking reduction in reporting requirements. The threshold change would by the Commission’s own estimates reduce filings from investment managers by 89.2% .2 This reduction would harm investors seeking to understand the ownership patterns and management influences of companies they own , issuers looking to engage their shareholders, academics and data providers who are able to conduct studies with the information provided , and the public and policy makers seeking to understand important public policy issues. The justification behind “modernizing” the reporting requirement is ahistorical and flawed: The Commission attempts to justify the increase in the threshold by stating that the increase to $3.5 billion reflects a proportionate increase in the percentage of t he total equity market covered by the disclosure requirements as compared to the percentage of the equity market covered by 1 A list of coalition members is available at: http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/about/our -coalition/ 2 Securities and Exchange Commission, File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (Jul. 10, 2020), at 17, https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf the $100 million requirement when the rule was first passed in 1975. However, this claimed justification ignores the Congressional i ntent behind the passage of Section 13(f). Based on the Senate report, this intent was explicitly based on the increasing significance of institutional investment managers in the equity market, not on any goal of covering a fixed percentage of the total eq uity market.3 Congress highlighted issues such as the concentrated power of institutional investors in affecting public companies and individual investors. Since the 1970s the importance of institutional investors in the market and the issues raised by th eir power have only grown. At times the Proposal seems to reflect an underlying goal of somehow minimizing the number of reporting entities while covering a certain percentage of the market. But this goal is in no way justified by either statutory intent or by any overall cost benefit analysis reflecting the costs of disclosure as compared to the benefits for issuers and investors of having timely and accurate disclosure of institutional equity ownership in public companies. The argument behind “modernizi ng” the reporting requirement fails to consider that the existing standards are already far too weak: Many institutional investors are now using options strategies and other derivatives that are not subject to reporting under the existing Form 13F to accumulate the economic equivalent of large equity pos itions . The current $100 million threshold is based on the total value of eligible securities and not the entire market value of the portfolio including equity -based derivatives and options . Thus, many of the institutional funds who would supposedly benefit from the proposed rule change have already been utilizing loopholes in the existing rule to avoid reporting significant positions.4 Such evasion often involves selling a put option which would be economically similar to buying stock , except is not subject to reporting on Form 13F while ordinary shares are .5 A recent example of this is involves hedge fund Elliott Management , which surpris ed the management of AT&T and its shareholders on September 9, 2019 by suddenly declaring a $3.2 billion stake in the company via “common stock and economic equivalents” in a letter to shareholders.6 Elliott Management’s 13 -F filing on November 14, 2019 (reflecting the fund’s holdings of only eligible securities at the end of September ) however, only show s a $118.25 million stake from its AT&T stock holdings alone .7 Having amassed this position, the hedge fund then demanded aggressive changes from AT&T’s management, including replacing its CEO, laying off workers, and selling key divisi ons. If one hedge fund that already manage d $42 billion in assets as of June8 can already avoid basic reporting under the current rules, how much worse would this problem become if the Commission were to raise the reporting requirement thirty five times as laid out in this proposal? 3 Report to Accompany S.249, Securities Act Amendments of 1975, S en.

It is particularly s tarting that at the very same time that the Commission seems bent on reducing the ability of ordinary shareholders to influence companies they own through the open and public shareholder resolution process , it would also make a proposal which would increase the extent to which hedge f unds and institutional investors could amass large stakes behind the scenes and thus increase their control of companies in an opaque and hidden manner. The Commission is disregarding the demands to increase reporting requirements from investor groups it is supposed to serve : Several market participants, as well as the Commission’s own Inspector General, have been calling on the SEC to do the opposite of what is proposed in this release and change reporting requirements to require more information to be disclosed. The Office of the Inspector General has been suggesting for nearly a decade9 that the 13F reporting be changed to: • Update the list of assets that need to be reported • Require reporting of an investor’s average holdings durin g the period to avoid “window dressing” • Disclose the aggregate purchases and sales during the quarter • Break out how much of the holdings are held in proprietary accounts versus customer accounts The NYSE, Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Pr ofessionals (SCSGP), and National Investor Relations Institute in 2011 called for reducing the current 45 -day reporting deadline to 15 days .10 These groups highlighted the “massive technological advances in recordkeeping and reporting systems over [30 year s]”; their comments suggest that ‘modernizing’ the rules should mean shortening the timeline The Commission should withdraw this proposal and instead consider updating 13F reporting to capture more information Given the serious problems with the existing 13F reporting , which would be made far worse by the changes contemplated in this proposa l, as well as calls from the IG and others for the Commission to move in the oppos ite direction by requiring more information on share ownership, not less, we believe the Commission should withdraw its proposal .

This proposal will allow 89% of all current 13F filers to cease reporti ng and “go dark”, which would result in a significant loss of market transp arency for small publicly traded firms such as University Bancorp, Inc., which is listed on the OTCQB Stock Exchange. On its surface the change in regulation is reasona ble, however when considered in light of another regulation, the SEC’s rules 14b-1 and 14b-2 regard ing “Objecting Benefici al Owners” and “Non- Objecting Beneficial Owner s”, it is most unwise. Speaking as a CEO of an OTCQB Stock Exchan ge Listed and publicly traded bank holding company, I think these other two rules are awful a nd should be changed, if you are going to change 1 Founded in 1890, University Bank® is the 15th oldest bank headquartered in Michigan. We are proud to have been selected as the ""Community Bankers of the Year"" by both American Banker magazine and the American Bankers Association and as the second fastest gr owing business of any type in the Greater Detroit Region by Crain’s Detroit Business. As of 6/30/2 020, University Bank was managing over $29 billion in financial assets for over 152,000 customers and our 4 78 employees make us the 5th largest bank based in Michigan.

UNIVERSITY BANK’S VISION: “WE BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR YOUR FUTURE”  EQUAL HOUSING LENDER  MEMBER FDIC the 13F Filer rules! All three of these rules be nefit big money Wall Street investors and prevent companies from interacting directly with or even knowing who some of their shareholders are. Why is it a problem? Under Securities and Exch ange Commission (SEC) rules, companies cannot know who their shareholders are because they ca nnot obtain shareholdings by Objecting Beneficial Owners. Rules 14b-1 requires brokers and banks to disclose to a compan y the identity of only those beneficial owners who do not object to such disclosure. Those who object are known as Objecting Beneficial Owners (OBO s) under the SEC’s rules. Compan ies like University Bancorp, Inc. cannot contact OBOs directly nor may they learn their ident ity. The company may only have direct contact with shareowners that have designated themselves Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners (NOBOs), owners who do not objec t to having their iden tity known to the issuing company. The OBO/NOBO distinction impedes company comm unications with beneficial owners and communications among shareowners. 3 Is it a large problem? Yes! Over 75 percent of customers holding sh ares in street name are OBOs, and 52-60 percent of the shares of publicly-held co mpanies in the United States are therefore held by OBOs. In effect, the identity of the ultimate bene ficial owner of more than half of all shares of publicly traded companies is unknown to th e company that these shareholders own. 4 It is bad public policy for the board and execu tive leadership of our nation’s la rgest firms not to be able to know for whom they are working, unable to cons ult with them when formulating policy and strategic decisions for their firm’s future. I draw your attention to a document the SE C has on their website, s7141022, available at: https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-22.pdf which has a more in depth discussion of these SEC rules in the context of problems that have come up with the rules, particularly in proxy fights, since companies cannot know who their shareholders are, if they opt to be Objecting Beneficial Owners.5 To summarize, if the SEC amends the SE C’s rules 14b-1 and 14b-2 regarding “Objecting Beneficial Owners” and “Non- Objec ting Beneficial Owners” to enable issuers of securities to be able to obtain a complete list of their share holders, University Bancorp, Inc. and many other publicly traded firms would support the proposed change to raise th e limit for 13F Filers. If the SEC does not amend the SEC’s rules 14b-1 and 14b- 2 regarding “Objecting Beneficial Owners” and “Non- Objecting Beneficial Own ers” and continues to prevent i ssuers of securities to learn the identity of their shareholders, we would *not* support the proposed change to raise the limit for 13F Filers. We urge the SEC to issue a proposed rulema king to amend the SEC’s rules 14b-1 and 14b-2 regarding “Objecting Beneficial Owners” and “Non- Objecting Be neficial Owners” to enable issuers of securities to be able to obtain a complete list of th eir shareholders and the contact information for those shareholders to enhance the ability of issuers of securities to directly communicate with their shareholders, to be better able to properly manage their firms for the long term in consultation with their shareholders. 3 https://katten.com/nobo and https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-22.pdf . 4 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-22.pdf . 5 Ibid.

YPF S.A. is a publicly traded corporation, incorporated under the laws of Argentina and registered as foreign issuer at the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and a Non U.S. NYSE - listed company. We are Argentina’s leading energy company, operating a fully integrated oil and gas chain with leading market positions across the domestic upstream, downstream and gas and power segments1. We would like to inform the SEC our opinion as a foreign issuer, regarding the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers , for the reasons explained in the following paragraphs . While we welcome the Commission’s interest in modernizing 13F reporting, and reduci ng institutional investors ’ compliance costs, we believe that the proposed amendments to raise the threshold for filing the form 13F to $3.5 billion from $100 million will : i) significantly reduce transparency regarding information about investments in corporate issuers such as YPF, ii) undermine issuer -investor engagement, iii) deprive us of timely information about the investments decisions of our investors, prevent our Investor Relations Office to target possible investors2, and Iv) be also harmful t o the public interest not to know how institutional investors are investing . In that sense, h aving less reporting data available on our shareholders’ equity positions will also be detrimental to our communication efforts - derived of a reduced investor engagement driven by fewer form 13F filings available - and our ability to track quarterly shareholder activity (as of today, 13F filings are the only accurate means of tracking institutional holdings ). 1 Please, refer to our 2019 20 Form: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/904851/000119312520119222/d872797d20f.htm 2 Please, refer to our Sustainability R eport - Transparency with Shareholders and Investors (page 11) https://www.ypf.com/english/TheCompa ny/Documents/YPF -Sustainability -report - 2018.pdf?_ga=2.131969223.937148738.1600438967 -290531826.1599049910 Clasificación YPF: No Confidencial Clasificación YPF: No Confidencial In addition, a detailed tracking of our investment registry , to inform shareholders positions, is vital to meet internal and external reporting requirements3.

Countryman , Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Mana gers (File Number S7 -08-20) The Alternative Investment Management Association Limited (AIMA)1 appreciate s the opportunity to provide comments in response to the proposed Rule 13f-1 (the ‘Proposed Rule’) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘Act’), which would update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports and would eliminate the omission threshold for individual securities on Form 13F.2 While we are supportive of the SEC’s efforts to modernis e reporting practices under Form 13F with the aim of providing regulatory relief t o institutional investment managers, we believe the SEC has not given sufficient consideration to the widespread uses of the data stemming from Form 13F reports , nor has it provided a detailed and balanced cost-benefit analysis that is necessary to support these proposals. We recognise that the Propos ed Rule would provide welcom e regulatory relief to many institutional investment managers , especially those foreign institutional investment managers whose only U.S. regulatory filing s may be the quarterly submission of Form 13F reports. However, as the SEC rightly acknowledges in it s Proposing Release, that increasing the reporting threshold would limit the data available to the market which is used for a wide variety of purposes.3 We do not believe that the Proposing Release has adequately explored or documented how and to what 1 AIMA, the Alternative Investment Management Association, is the global representative of the alternative investment industry, with more than 1,900 corporate members in over 60 countries.

Without having a comprehensive overview of the full uses of Form 13F data, it is difficult to determine whether the increased threshold is a necessary and much needed course of action, or would have a material negative impact on market participants who have built up a reliance interest in this data In our view, the SEC also did not adequately assess the costs born e by members of the domestic, and foreign, equity capi tal market system. We further believe that the reporting costs and burden s as described in the Proposing Release may not fully represent an accurate description of current practices as many Form 13F reports are automatically collated and submitted. We note that the Proposing Release also does not consider the external costs of making such filings, such as the licensing fee charged for the use of the CUSIP numbers in Form 13F filings. In addition , we do not agree with the SEC’s proposal to eliminate the omission threshold that permits the exclusion of holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amount of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggregat e fair market value. We believe this proposal runs counter to the SEC’s intention to provide regulatory relief as the elimination of the threshold would, in practice and when combined with the proposal to increase the threshold , require large investment managers to provide granular information f or each individual position it holds, thereby outweigh ing the cost and time savings for investment managers resulting from the aforementioned increase of the Form 13F reporting threshold . Moreover, remo ving the exclusion would increas e the risk that portfolio strategies could be reverse engineered to the significant detriment of the filing institutional investment managers. We are in favour of the technical amendments put forward in the Proposing Release as well as the requirement for filers to provide additional identifying information. We would be happy to elaborate further on any of the points raised in this letter.

Transparency of ownership is critically important to the smooth functioning of the securities industry and our members appreciate the SEC’s efforts to modernize this process. We agree that this issue is due for modernization , since the existing rules were adopted over forty years ago and the industry has changed significantly in that time. ACLI fully supports the SEC’s goal of transparency, as well as the state d goals of the 13F disclosure program to: “[1] create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers, [2] improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of insti tutional investment managers and thus [3] facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence and [4] to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” We appreciate the intent of these efforts in supporting the SEC’s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and f acilitate capital formation. However, we believe that the proposed amendment would pose a significant threat to transparency. It is necessary for companies to have full visibility into the ownership of their stock in order to act in the best interests of their investors. In this case, we are concerned that the resulting loss of transparency is not outweighed by the potential advantages of the proposal. In addition , life insurance companies are significant investors in corporate bonds, which are frequent ly issued by publicly -traded companies. Life insurance companies rely on ownership information sourced from Form 13F in their credit risk assessments, particularly with respect to M&A/change of control risk , which is a significant risk for corporate credi t investors. Reduced transparency brought by this proposal would work against large bondholders by reducing transparency from activist and other hedge fund investors seeking to advance actions that may be harmful to bondholder s. When appropriate, we adv ocate for efficiency in order to minimize unnecessary operational and regulatory burden. We also recognize that there is often a balancing of interests required. In this matter, while we understand the Commission is seeking to modernize the disclosure process , we think that the proposed new threshold would pose a significant threat to transparency. ACLI shares several of the concerns expressed in the comments submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) , specifically those regarding the negative impact this change would have on retail investors and small and mid -cap issuers. We encourage the Commission to follow the recommendation of NIRI and other commenters to withdraw the new proposal. We also agree with NIRI’s assessment that the proposed changes alone are too significant and should instead be part of a holistic review of the framework for disclosure. We would look forward to continuing to work together with the Commission, other organizations, and stakeholders on a holistic approach to reviewing the framework for disclosure. If the SEC decides to proceed with amending the threshold, we encourage the Commission to consider a lower amount . As noted, w e believe that the amended threshold that has been proposed is too high and would significantly reduce transparency for companies, bondholders and all stakeholders . We appreciate and support the Commission’s efforts to modernize the disclosure process and agree with other commentators that this issue requires a more comprehensive, thoughtful review. We stand ready to answer any questions and thank the Commission for the opportunity to present these comments for your consideration.

While we understand the intent of the proposed rule is to return its scope, in terms of the number of filers, closer to the level when the original rule was adopted in 1978, we do not believe the proposal takes current market dynamics into consideration. With the explosion of hedge funds, dynamic trading and activist investors since that time, issuers need more visibility into institutional investor activity, not less. It’s critical that we know about the activities of our institutional investors, even if they are conducted through smaller funds. Further, we believe regular communication with our investors is a best practice, and our investor relations team relies on the information provided by 13F reports to identify holders of our stock for this purpose. To maintain transparency, we believe the rule should continue to apply to institutional investors with portfolios in excess of $100 million. We also recommend the Commission consider amendments that would improve transparency, such as reducing the filing period down from its current 45-day requirement and expanding reporting requirements to include derivative positions. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and this proposal would be a significant step backwards at a time when stakeholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 rule-comments@sec.gov Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7- 08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: We hereby respectfully submit our comments on the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. As a publicly traded company, NorthWestern Corporation ( NorthWestern ) relies on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts – as it is the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around holdings, significantly undermining issuer -investor engagement , particularly for small and mid- cap companies such as NorthWestern. Based on reporting data dated June 30, 2020, there were 348 institutional holders holding 48.4 million outstanding shares of NorthWestern Corporation (or 96.5 percent of total shares outstanding). If the proposed amendments were enacted, we would lose visibility on approximately 82 of our shareholders (or 23.6 percent) that also are 13F filers, a significant loss of market transparency. We believe that the proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize our shareholder engagement efforts by excluding more t han 5,000 investment managers nationally – or nearly 90% of all filers – from disclosure. The hallmark principle of U.S. securities laws is transparency. The statutes and rules are designed to allow investors and the SEC to make informed decisions , whether requiring disclosure regarding a registrant’s business and results of operations, an investment advisor’s performance record, or a broker -dealer’s disclosure financial capacity . The same is true with respect to the institutional investor disclosures required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in particular Sections 13(d), 13(f) and 13(g). The proposed amendments, however, appear to place a limitation on transparency that is at odds with the Commission’s regulatory agenda in general and with how the Commission itself has explained access to information and its role in facilitating such access: Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 2 “Only through the steady flow of timely, comprehensive, and accurate information can people make sound investment decisions. The result of this information flow is a far more active, efficient, and transparent capital market that facilitates the capital formation to our nation’s economy.” The material reduction in information and ownership transparency that would result from the proposed amendments would deliver a debilitating blow for investor relations teams who lead shareholder engagement for public issuers and are in constant search for information regarding the owners of their companies. As highlighted by the NorthWestern -specific statistics in the third paragraph of these comments, the proposed amendments reduce the information and ownership transparency, which is even more pronounced at mid- and small -cap companies. Put simply, if an issuer does not know who owns it, how can it properly engage with its owners? The role of the investor relations officer at corporate issuers has grown in importance as institutional ownership of the U.S. equity markets has grown. Regular and informed communication and access to management teams, all within the rul es and subject to Regulation Fair Disclosure, are now best practices at a vast majority of the corporate issuers listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and other U.S. securities exchanges. Form 13F data is a foundational element of the tactical, daily decisions that investor relations professionals render every day. The proposed amendments also miss the opportunity to update the 13F ruleset in other ways that would benefit both issuers and investors. Many have long advocated for modernization of the length of the 45 -day delay period under Rule 13f -1 for submission of data by institutional investor holdings. Unfortunately, despite recent initiatives calling for streamlined communication and transparency between public companies and investors, the Commission has declined to advance rulemaking to address the long overdue deficiencies in the timeframe for reporting Form 13F data. We recommend that the Commission maintain the current $100 million reporting threshold. It is, most often, these smaller institutional investors that are most active in trying to influence the behavior of individual corporations, and thereby important to other investors. To the extent that the Commission increases the threshold, we believe that it should increase the threshold only by a modest amount, say to $200 or $300 million, more in line with the inflation -adjusted value. To the extent that the Com mission increases the threshold to a higher level, we would encourage a two- tiered threshold with a lower threshold – the existing $100 million threshold – applicable to any institutional investor that within the past five years has proposed, or in the fut ure reasonably could be expected to, propose to an issuer any extraordinary transaction, any transfer of a material amount of assets, any change in its board of Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 3 directors, any material change in its capitalization or dividends, any other material change to the business or corporate structure, or any change in charter or bylaws. This list of purposes is derived from Item 4 of Schedule 13D and would be well -understood by institutional investors and not impose an additional compliance burden. NorthWestern stro ngly supports transparency in the securities marketplace. We ask that the Commission reconsider the implications of this proposed rule and, instead, refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and the proposed amendments would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the Commission to withdraw the proposed amendm ents. Sincerely, Timothy P. Olson Senior Corporate Counsel & Corporate Secretary tim.olson@northwestern.com O 605-978-2924"

We are also a signatory to the New York Stock Exchange’s comment letter dated September 21, 2020, which also expresses opposition to the proposed revision. While revising the reporting threshold to reflect the change in size and structure of the U.S. equities market since 1975 makes sense from a theoretical perspective, the practical implications of such an approach include only approximately 45% of our owners currently reporting their holding in the company through Form 13F continuing to do so. This significant reduction in market transparency significantly reduces our ability to (1) effectively engage with a majority of institutional owners that hold an equity stake in our company and (2) gain intelligence regarding activist hedge funds or other entities accumulating significant (but less than 5%) positions in our stock . There is no alternative source of ownership information that is obtained through 13F reporting. As a result, the current proposal would remove significant market data wit hout the presence of an alternative source. While we join many other s in welcoming the modernization of 13F reporting, we believe the current propos al to increase the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion would create negative impacts that outweigh the perceived benefits . As a result, we believe that the current threshold of $100 million should be maintained, or a more measured and incremental increase should be considered. 1 The Lumen brand was launched on September 1 4, 2020.

The legal name CenturyLink, Inc. is expected to be formally changed to Lumen Technologies, Inc. upon the completion of all applicable requirements. 2 One such alternative approach discussed in the proposing release is an increase tied to inflation.2 As noted in the release, an upward adjustment tied to CPI would increase the reporting threshold to $500 million (applying a rounding convention to the nearest $100 million) and reduce the number of filers from 5,089 to 1,904. T he increase in the threshold from $100 million to $500 million would result in significantly over 70% of our owners currently reporting their holding in the company through Form 13F continuing to do so (as opposed to only approximately 45% under the current proposal) . In addition to mitigating market transparency impacts to our company and similarly situated companies, t his alternative approach would : • achieve an estimated decrease of $47,775,000 to $95,550,000 in direct compliance cost savings, based upon the per -manager estimate of $15,000 to $30,000 set forth in the release; • accomplish the reasonable objective of reducing the burden on Commission staff to field Form 13F questions and related Form 13F CTRs ; • be consistent with other recent adjustments by the Commission in other areas, such as increases to the public float thresholds for accelerated filer and large accelerated filer status ; and • preclude the need for the staff to conduct periodic reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold and serve as a consistent basis upon which to adopt a periodic automatic adjustment to the Form 13F reporting threshold. We do support two particular aspects of the Commission’s current proposal; namely (1) the recommendation to eliminate the omission of the Form 13F reporting threshold for individual securities and (2) the requirement to managers to provide additional identifying information. For the reasons previously articulated to the Commission by the NYSE Group, National Investor Relations Institute and Society for Corporate Governance, we also support (1) increasing the 13F reporting cadence and (2) the shortening of the reporting deadline after the completion of each reporting period. 3 We also share the view of other issuers to expand the scope of 13F reporting to capture equity derivative products which are not currently captured in the reporting.4 These revisions would increase transparency to issuers about their investor base and to the investment community more generally.

We believe that the Commission’ s proposal would significantly i mpair engagement with our institutional investors about our business strategy and corpora te governance, deprive us of timely information about activist funds t hat take significant position s in our stock, and exacerbate short- term pressures on our company at the expense of long-term share holder value. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on public companies a nd their obligation to confer regularly with their investors. We are particularly concerned a bout how the reduction of 13F tr ansparency would impair our ability to identify our most ac tive shareholders and engage eff ectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 7 of our current top 25 13F filers to evade disclosure.1 While our largest investors woul d continue to disclose their ownership, many of those inst itutions are passive, indexed hold ers with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For Ligand, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the $3.5 billion threshold that is far more valuable. By understanding our investor base , we are better able to understa nd trading in our stock, as well as potential abuses and market manipulation. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data U.S. companies have that shows which “street name” investors ar e buying or selling their share s each quarter. This data cannot be 2 • 3911 Sorrento Valley Blvd., Suite 110 • San Diego, CA 92121 • p:(858) 550‐7500 • US-DOCS \117831330.2 replaced by hiring stock surveilla nce firms, which themselves r ely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for thei r research efforts. The loss of this essential 13F data also would impede our compa ny’s ability to attract new investors. Like many other issu ers, we use 13F filings to ident ify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure th e effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investor s. Both of these practices are e ssential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business. The loss o f transparency around who is buying our shares each quarter w ould hinder the ability of our company to continue to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the Commis sion should fully consider the negative impact on capit al formation before proceeding with thi s rulemaking. The loss of 13F data will also expose our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short- term-oriented fund managers, who m ay demand that we slash jobs, reduce research spending, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long-term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly distraction, so many public companies often conclude they have no choice but to settle with short-term activists. Without the 13F data we receiv e now, Ligand will not know if a pack of activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 billion threshold) are plotting a prox y contest until 10 days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly s urfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Additionally, over the past five years the Commission has signi ficantly increased the disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. We a pplaud the dir ection reporting is going with corporate disclosures; it’s right for companies to do so, and i nvestors deserve as much information as possible about w hat they own. However, this new proposal is taking information on investors in the opposite directi on with less and less trans parency. The resulti ng imbalance is unfair as proposed. Investors deserve to know what they own, a nd companies deserve to know who owns their stock. It would be even more beneficial to have clarity on shor t sellers of securities as well. This is c urrently a veritable black box wi th no visibility at all into which institutions might be shorting a company’s stock, and how many shares they are short. Indeed, we believe the Commission should expand the 13F disclos ure to require investors to report short positions. The Commission’s 13F rule proposal mak es the stock market less transparent when in fact the Commission should seek to provide more information about investors and short sellers who m anipulate companies’ stock. For the foregoing reasons, we re quest that the Commission withd raw these proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue th e common-sense reforms detailed in rulemaking petitions 3 • 3911 Sorrento Valley Blvd., Suite 110 • San Diego, CA 92121 • p:(858) 550‐7500 • US-DOCS \117831330.2 submitted by National Investor R elations Institute, the NYSE Gr oup, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.2 Rather than reduce market trans parency, we urge the Commissio n to modernize 13F by cutting the archaic 45-day reporting period, r equiring the public disclosure of short positions, and supporting m onthly disclosure by 13F filer s.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7- 08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, On July 10, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) issued a request for public comment soliciting input on proposed rule amendments to 17 CFR 240.13f -1 (“Rule 13f -1”) and Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. By this letter, IAA, Inc. is providing its comments to the Commission’s proposal. As part of the Rule 13f -1 amendments, the Commission is proposing to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, requiring an investment manager to file a quarterly Form 13F report with the Commission only if the accounts over which the manager exercises investment discretion hold an aggregate of $3.5 billion in securities covered by Rule 13f- 1. The Commission states in its proposing release that this 35 times increase in the reporting threshold would result in an approximate 89% decline in the number of investment managers req uired to file a Form 13F. We believe this increase in the reporting threshold will have unintended adverse consequences for many public companies, including IAA, who have come to rely on the ownership information provided by Form 13F filings. Shareholder Transparency and Engagement IAA, like most public companies, is owned predominantly by institutional shareholders. Based on the most recent data available, institutional shareholders currently own more than 95% of our outstanding shares. Nearly all instit utional shareholders own their shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee account rather than on a registered basis. IAA depends on third party data to identify these shareholders and have visibility into their holdings, including any changes in such holdings. The current Form 13F, as adopted by the Commission in 1975, includes the following text, which acknowledges this important utility of Form 13F (emphasis added): “The purpose of Form 13F is to provide a reporting and disclosure system to collect specific information and to disseminate such information to the public about the holdings of institutional investment managers who exercise investment discretion over certa in accounts of equity securities. . . . . We believe that investors will find Form 13F report information useful in tracking institutional investor holdings in their investments and that issuers, too, will find detail as to institutional investor holdings useful because much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.” We use and rely on Form 13F ownership information to identify new investors in IAA and to monitor the buying, selling and holding activities of our investors. This information allows us to better understand our shareholder base and, therefore, to make more informed decisions about how to effectively engage with our shareholders and prioritize our engagement opportunities. It also allows us to focus outreach efforts on our newest or most active investors as circumstances warrant. We use Form 13F ownership information to plan our formal shareholder outreach in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders, as well as in connection with our day -to-day investor relations activities. As demonstrated by the comment letter submitted by the NYSE Group, Inc. on September 21, 2020 1, which summarizes the average percentage of shares outstanding and institutional shareholders that would be lost (based on issuer market capitalization) if the proposal is adopted by the Commission, the lost visibility that we and other public companies will encounter is not insignificant. For example, among just our top 50 institutional shareholders, representing more than approximately 85% of our outstanding shares, the Commission’s proposal would impair our ability to identify th e ownership and investment activity of shareholders owning approximately 9% of our outstanding shares. This percentage increases to approximately 12% of our outstanding shares based on our current top 100 shareholders. We believe any attempt to diminish what is already an imperfect system will further weaken the market transparency that Form 13F filings currently provide. Shareholder Activism We also use the institutional ownership information available from Form 13F filings to help identify and monitor shareholders whose investment in our common stock may reflect short -term motivations or other activist intent. Understanding our shareholder base and movements in and out of our stock by institutional shareholders, particularly those with activist tendenc ies, is critical to helping us identify particular threats as well as potential “wolf pack” followers. While Form 13F filings do not allow us visibility on a real- time basis, they do help tremendously in flagging potential accumulations of our shares by a ctivist shareholders. The lower Form 13F reporting threshold could make us and other public companies more vulnerable to stealth activist campaigns that may be costly, disruptive and not in the best interests of our shareholders. Form 13F filings provid e us an advance warning that other Commission filings do not. In particular, Schedule 13D and 13G reports are required to be filed only after a shareholder has acquired beneficial ownership of five percent or more of our outstanding stock. Importantly, if Schedule 13D and 13G filings were the only reports of share ownership available, we would likely miss becoming aware of many potential activists holding shares of our common stock because, in many cases, these shareholders intentionally maintain their rep ortable beneficial ownership below five percent to avoid Schedule 13D reporting. 1 See https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7- 08-20/s70820- 7797941 -223589.pdf . Significantly, the increase in the reporting threshold for Form 13F filings from $100 million to $3.5 billion that the Commission has proposed will enable a large number of shareholder activists —including some of the most active— to accumulate company shares under the radar. According to the SharkWatch 50 table of key activists published by FactSet, only 11 of the top 50 activists would be required to file Form 13F quarterly ownership information if the Rule 13f- 1 reporting threshold is increased as proposed by the Commission. Conclusion For the above reasons, we believe the Commission’s proposal to increase the Rule 13f -1 reporting threshold fails to adequately consider or balance the adverse impact that the rule change would have on public companies. While ownership information reported on Form 13Fs is not perfect due to delayed quarterly reporting and limits in the type of information required to be reported, Form 13Fs n onetheless provide the broadest and most complete picture of share ownership by institutional holders and cannot be adequately replaced by data from other sources, such as Schedule 13D or 13G filings or N -PORT filings by registered management investment co mpanies. We believe there are other actions the Commission should take to improve the current reporting and disclosure system for institutional shareholder ownership and modernize the reporting framework to better reflect current market dynamics. This inc ludes rulemaking to address shortcomings in current Section 13(d) beneficial ownership reporting, especially relating to the reporting deadline and ownership of derivative securities, and actions to improve —not weaken —the transparency of Form 13F ownership reporting in a manner that balances the interests of both investment managers and the companies in which they invest. We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the process, and would be pleased to discuss our comments or any questions that the Comm ission or its staff may have, which may be directed to Sidney Peryar at (708) 492 -7369. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Sidney Peryar Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer"

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: File Number S7 -08-20; Release 34 -89290; Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman : Managed Funds Association (“MFA”)1 welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposal to update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports filed by i nstitutional investment managers and to make other changes to Form 13F. MFA’s comments reflect our members’ perspectives as institutional investors in public companies managing assets on behalf of their underlying investors, including public and private pension funds, endowments, and charitable organizations, among other sophisticated investors. MFA supports the SEC ’s willingness to review longstanding rules and update those rules when their costs and burdens outweigh their benefits. For the reasons discuss ed below, however, we believe that the SEC should conduct further analysis on the costs and benefits of the proposal before deciding whether to adopt a revised reporting threshold. As noted in the SEC’s release describing the proposal (“Proposing Release”) , it has been 45 years since the agency adopted the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers set out in Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Much has changed in the U.S. equities market and in the investme nt management industry since that time , including the size of U.S. markets and the ways that investors use Form 13F information . As discussed below, we are concerned that the Proposing Release does not fully consider the important ways investors use Form 1 3F information . We believe that reconsideration of the costs and benefits of Form 13F information is necessary to determine whether the threshold should be amended and, if so, at what level. We also provide comments on proposed changes to the omission thre shold, technical 1 MFA represents the global alternative investment industry and its investors by advocating for public policies that foster efficient, transparent, fair capital markets, and competitive tax and regulatory structures.

Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 2 of 5 amendments, and proposed changes to the standard for seeking confidential treatment , which we believe the Commission should consider if it determines to move forward with final rulemaking . Reporting Threshold The SEC noted in the Proposing Release that, when it originally adopted Form 13F, it “attempted to structure the form in a manner that would provide useful data regarding holdings that would impact the markets, while minimizing the form’s reporting burdens .” In considering whether to revise the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers, we believe that the SEC did not fully account for the variety of ways that market participants use Form 13F information . As a result, the Proposing Release underestimate d the costs associated with the loss of publicly available information that would result from the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. The SEC noted that since Form 13F data became publicly available, market participants have developed a variety of uses for the data. While the SEC described a number of these uses in the Proposing Release, we believe that the SEC did not fully consider the range of the uses of Form 13F data, which is critical to determining the costs associated with the loss of that data. For example, many managers use aggregate Form 13F data for risk management purposes, such as assessing whether a particular trade is crowded. This analysis is a valuable risk management tool to assess the impact of aggregate ownership of securities by institutional investment managers on the securities markets. We understand that allocators use Form 13F data as part of their due diligence on managers with whom they invest . MFA also is aware that some public companies use Form 13F data to help identify and engage with their shareholders. We encourage the SEC to reconsider its cost - benefit analysis in accounting for these different uses of Form 13F data. According to the Proposing Release, the proposed increase in the reporting threshold would result in a reduction in the dollar amount of assets reported on Forms 13F of approximately 10% from current levels, and a reduction of approximately 90% in the number of investment managers that file Form 13F reports. We believe the reduction in the number of investment managers filing Form 13F reports is material given the uses of Form 13F data described above , in particular with respect to assessing the impact of aggregate ownership of a security by institutional investment mana gers. We also believe that a 10% reduction in data, measured by dollars, is a material reduction in the data, thereby imposing costs on market participants that use Form 13F information. T he additional indirect costs caused by a reduction of available info rmation will be borne by a wide range of market participants, including small managers that use the data for risk management or other purposes. MFA requests that the SEC reconsider the materiality of the costs associated with the proposed reduction in information, both with respect to the decline in information by dollar value and by number of managers required to report . In MFA’s view, the Proposing Release also overestimates some of the cost savings involved with raising the reporting threshold and the materiality of those costs . Many managers have deployed technology to make the ir Form 13F reporting efficient, which we believe minimizes the costs of filing for all managers and limits the likelihood that larger managers will have significant cost burdens associated with filing Form 13F. Further, even managers that would have some direct cost savings if they were no longer required to file Form 13F would have increased indirect costs associated with the loss of publicly available information. We believe that the SEC should reconsider the net benefits to managers given the relatively small amount of direct cost savings and the increased costs associated with the loss of information. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 3 of 5 Given the concerns discussed above, w e believe it is important for the SEC to provide a further opportunity for public review and comment of a revised cos t-benefit analysis through a re - proposal , if the Commission decides to move forward with a revised reporting threshold . This approach would provide market participants the opportunity to address whether a modified approach to the reporting threshold addres ses the ir identified concerns. To the extent the SEC decides to move forward with rulemaking, we further encourage it to modify the proposed rules to address the issues discussed in more detail below. Omission Threshold Form 13F currently allows, but does not require, an investment manager to exclude holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amount of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggregate fair market value (the “de minimis exclusion”) of securities requir ed to be reported under Section 13(f). In the Proposing Release, the SEC explained that it had adopted the de minimis exclusion in seeking to further its goals of structuring Form 13F in a manner that would provide meaningful holdings data while minimizing the Form’s reporting burdens. The SEC concluded that aggregate holdings in the amounts covered by the de minimis exclusion were unlikely to have a material effect on the market. The SEC proposed eliminating the de minimis exclusion, saying that it believ es that by substantially increasing the Form 13F reporting threshold, the exclusion would no longer be necessary or appropriate. The SEC also stated that investment managers meeting the proposed higher reporting threshold would find reporting all positions less burdensome than for other managers, and that the incremental cost would be “immaterial.” MFA disagrees with the proposal to eliminate the de minimis exclusion and respectfully asks the SEC to retain this provision in any final rule. The original rea son cited by the SEC for the de minimis exclusion, that it excludes positions that are so small that they are unlikely to have a material effect on the market, remains true today. The proposal to increase the reporting threshold does not make these small positions any more significant than they would be otherwise. Moreover, while MFA agrees that larger investment managers likely have technological solutions to aid their reporting, eliminating the de minimis exclusion would require those managers to reprogr am their systems to be able to include those positions, which would result in some increased cost for those managers. Technical Changes MFA generally supports the proposed technical amendments in Section II.E. of the Proposing Release and encourages the SE C to adopt those proposed changes if it moves forward with rulem aking. Confidential Treatment Requests Form 13F data generally becomes public upon filing. Section 13(f)(4) of the Exchange Act provides that the SEC may prevent or delay public disclosure of information reported on Form 13F in accordance with applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). An investment manager desiring that the SEC treat its Form 13F data confidentially must submit a request for confidential treatment in accordance with the procedures described on the Form. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 4 of 5 Instruction 2.d to the Instructions for Form 13F C onfidential Treatment Requests currently requires that an investment manager seeking confidential treatment “[d]emonstrate that failure to grant the request for confidential treatment would be likely to cause substantial harm to the [m]anager’s competitive position; show what use competitors could make of the information and how harm to the [m]anager could ensue.” The SEC proposed to amend this instruction to require managers to “demonstrate that the information is both customarily and actually kept private by the manager, and to show how the release of this information could cause harm to the manager.” The SEC explained in the Proposing Release that the amendment is necessitated by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision in the case of Food Marketing Insti tute v. Argus Leader Media (“FMI”), which the SEC described as having changed the standard for determining whether information is “confidential” under exemption 4 of the FOIA. MFA believes that the SEC’s proposal is not necessary and that the existing sta ndard is both appropriate and not inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision. The facts and circumstances surrounding the FMI case are distinguishable from those surrounding Form 13F reporting. In FMI, certain sensitive data was required to be reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and applicable regulations provided assurances to the reporting companies that such data would not be disclosed publicly. The Department was challenged in court over its refus al to release the requested data , pursuant to an exemption under FOIA . The lower court found that the confidentiality provision included an unstated requirement that disc losure be likely to cause substantial harm to the reporting company, based on precedents established in prior cases. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the common understanding of the term “confidential” at the time the FOIA exemption was adopted re flected no such requirement. Form 13F reports, in contrast to those described in FMI, are not filed with any assurance of confidentiality. As the SEC noted in the Proposing Release, the information reported on Form 13F becomes publicly available upon filin g, unless the reporting institutional investment manager requests confidential treatment and the SEC agrees to grant such treatment. This difference from the reporting at issue in FMI is significant and distinguishes the Form 13F reporting requirement from the matter at issue in that case. In addition, investment managers act as agents on behalf of clients who own the relevant securities, creating a fundamentally different fact pattern than in FMI, with respect to who may have access to the information for which confidentiality is being sought. Unlike the facts and circumstances in FMI, investment managers provide information on a regular basis to clients and investors that nonetheless could appropriately be considered private and confidential . It is unclear , however, whether providing investors and clients with information about their holdings could be deemed to preclude a manager from seeking confidential treatment, a result that would effectively nullify the statutory right to request confidential treatment. In light of the significant distinction s between FMI and Form 13F reporting , MFA asks the SEC to reconsider the necessity of making the proposed change , which wou ld create significant uncertainty with respect to the circumstances in which the SEC grants confidential treatment . Should the SEC determine to proceed with a change to the standards for requesting confidential treatment, the requirement that the informa tion be “customarily and actually kept private” would need to be accompanied by practical guidance to investment managers how they can meet this standard. Given the need for practical guidance, we encourage the SEC not to make the Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 5 of 5 proposed change effective until the SEC has issued such guidance. To the extent the SEC proceeds with a proposed change in light of FMI, we also encourage the SEC to reconsider whether the requirement for a manager to show harm is consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision. MFA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the SEC in response to the Proposing Release. While we appreciate the SEC’s willingness to review and consider updates to longstanding rules, we believe further consideration of the costs associated with the proposed change to the Form 13F filing threshold is needed before the SEC makes a decision on whether to enact a change to the threshold . If you have any questions regarding any of these comments, or if we can provide further informatio n with respect to these or other issues, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned at (202) 730 -2600.

We support the opposition to the implementation of the proposed amendments expressed by the National Investor Relations Institute (“NIRI”) in its letter to the Commission dated August 28, 20201, and while we appreciate the Commission’s need to modernize reporting, we believe the focus of such modernization should be more frequent reporting and more extensive disclosure consistent with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”). The proposed increase in the reporting threshold for investment managers with assets under management to US$3.5 billion from the current US$100 million undermines the needs of both issuers and the investment community, particularly in terms of identifying an issuer’s investor base for shareholder communications and proxy access. As a leading provider of depositary receipt (“DR”) services, with US$499 billion in DR assets under custody2, BNY Mellon understands that transparency of ownership is a key challenge for publicly traded companies. Restricting Form 13F filing requirements to investors holding more than US$3.5 billion in eligible securities would have a negative impact on international issuers accessing the U.S. capital markets particularly in their efforts to identify and communicate with the broadest possible group of shareholders. Foreign private issuers look to the U.S. markets to diversify their shareholder base; U.S. investors in turn gain greater access to investment opportunities in the leading global companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.3 Issuers also use timely and complete Form 13F filings to identify those investors who are likely to purchase their equity securities by comparing the holdings of peer securities disclosed in these investor’s portfolios. The proposed increased Form 13F filing threshold would significantly reduce the quantity and quality of investor information publicly available and may be seen as a step backwards for issuers, U.S. investors, and from the stated intentions of Congress as expressed in Dodd-Frank. 1 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7709057-222930.pdf 2 International Data Corporation as of June 30, 2020 (accessed July 17, 2020). 3 Issuers such as Toyota Motor and Royal Dutch Shell who appear on the Forbes 2000 list of the world’s largest global companies. https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#6acb790e335d 3 BNY Mellon and other depositary banks, sponsored DR programs only, as of August 25, 2020. 4, 5, 6 Source: Data provided by IHS Markit, as of 8/20/2020. There are currently 401 non-U.S. companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges using sponsored American depositary receipts (“ADRs”).4 As it stands, the reduced investor disclosure under the proposed amendments would affect these issuers significantly. As many as 83% of investors that currently disclose positions in ADRs via Form 13F would no longer be required to report. These investors represent 11.1% of depositary receipts holdings overall.4 In addition, as proposed, opportunistic investors could build significant positions without detection by issuers or other investors, particularly since 91% of hedge funds would no longer required to report their ADR holdings.5 Finally, the amendments will further compound the lack of transparency for OTC-traded (“Level I”) ADRs: as proposed, 72% of investors who report their positions in Level I ADRs would no longer need to report – representing 62.4% of the OTC DR Institutional Ownership, according to available data.6 Companies issue securities on the U.S. markets in order to broaden access to investors who wish to participate in their growth. Correspondingly, U.S. institutional investors enjoy access to and connectivity with the companies in which they currently have an ownership stake. Any action that decreases the transparency of this relationship could impact the attractiveness of the U.S. markets for both international issuers and U.S. investors alike.

Saunders Road, Lake Forest, IL 60045 September 29, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34‐89290; File No. S7‐08‐20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Horizon Therapeutics plc, a biopharmaceutical company focused on rare disease medicines, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. The SEC’s proposal, which would allow almost 90 percent of current 13F filers to “go dark,” would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long‐term investors and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only source of quarterly ownership information available to our company and other U.S. issuers. While 13F information is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We are concerned as to whether the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on corporate issuers and our obligation to regularly confer with investors throughout the year. We are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would exclude approximately 18 percent of our current 13F filers from disclosure, including several of our top shareholders. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 2 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec ‐ proposed ‐rule‐change‐step‐193708183.html . 2 IHS Markit estimates that 86 percent of activist investors would no longer have to report their positions through 13F filings. IHS Markit, “SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,” August 7, 2020, available at: https://ipreo.com/blog/secs ‐13f‐proposal‐issuer‐and‐investor‐analysis/ . 150 S. Saunders Road, Lake Forest, IL 60045 ‐ 2 ‐ Engagement Our company uses 13F data in relation to engagement with our shareholders – in the proactive outreach we conduct with investors, in prioritizing the substantial number of investor requests for calls or meetings, and in the regular corporate governance outreach we conduct twice yearly with our top shareholders. Engagement is a cornerstone of our commitment to and relationship with the investors who own our company – and is an area that would be significantly affected by the 13F proposal, considerably limiting visibility into our shareholder base. Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long‐term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. The proposal is particularly concerning from our perspective as a biopharmaceutical company, given that the median assets under management for specialist healthcare providers is $413 million3, which falls significantly below the SEC’s proposed $3.5 billion threshold. Attracting new investors and measuring our effectiveness are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and grow our business. The 13F proposal would make these practices even more challenging. Activism The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes our company to a greater risk of “ambush activism” by short‐term‐oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks or take other measures that may not be part of our long‐term strategy, the investment strategy of our long‐term investors or in the best interest of many of our shareholders. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism, as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.4 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021‐22 after the pandemic subsides (as occurred after the financial crisis of 2008‐09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for public companies and long‐term investors.5 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company would not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. 3 Analysis by Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) of 13F filing data of more than 100 investors concentrated in the healthcare space, accumulated and sorted by WhaleWisdom (https://whalewisdom.com ) and referenced in https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 ‐08‐20/s70820 ‐7773212‐223397.pdf . 4 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post‐Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate ‐governance/insight ‐preparing ‐for‐post‐pandemic ‐ corporate ‐activism . 5 See, for example., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post‐Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism ‐in‐the‐post‐pandemic ‐market‐what‐you‐need‐to‐know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepare for post‐ pandemic activism,” April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how ‐boards‐can‐prepare‐post‐pandemic ‐ activism . 150 S.

We also encourage the SEC to convene a public roundtable on potential 13F reforms and other market transparency issues, including 13D modernization and deterring “short and distort” abuses.

Countryman Secretary Securi ties and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Dear Ms. Countryman: RE: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers - File Number S7 -08-20 We appreciate the opportunity to provide input to the proposed rule, Report ing Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers. The rule seeks to amend Rule 13f -1 which requires that managers file quarterly reports on Form 13F if they hold an aggregate of more than $100 million in 13(f) securities. The Commission proposes to rais e the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, with an aim to reduce the burden of reporting on smaller investment managers. XBRL US is a nonprofit standards organization, with a mission to improve the efficiency and quality of reporting in the U.S. by promo ting the adoption of business reporting standards. XBRL US is a jurisdiction of XBRL International, the nonprofit consortium responsible for developing and maintaining the technical specification for XBRL (a free and open data standard widely used around t he world for reporting by public and private companies, banks, and government agencies). Our members include accounting firms, public companies, software, data and service providers, as well as other nonprofits and standards organizations. While we suppo rt the Commission goal of reducing the burden on reporting entities, we do not believe that eliminating disclosures made by smaller reporting entities is an appropriate approach. Numerous stakeholders, as the Commission points out in the proposal, rely on this data including regulators, investors, the media, public companies, and other types of researchers. The value of this data has only grown over time and 13F data has become an expected resource. The Commission has received an overwhelming number of responses to this proposal, the majority of which do not support the move to raise the threshold. There are, however, alternate approaches to reduce the burden on reporting entities. First, we recommend that the Commission require the use of an open, nonproprietary s ecurities identifier, such as the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) instead of the CUSIP, to reduce the financial burden on investment managers imposed by the requirement to use proprietary, costly identifiers. Second, we ask that the Commissio n consider adopting XBRL -CSV as a replacement to the current custom XML schema reporting requirements. Page 2 of 4 These changes to current reporting requirements would reduce the burden on investment managers, and would increase the usefulness and quality of report ed data, as noted in our response to specific proposal questions below: Value of 13F data Question 9: What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? 13F data from smaller managers is just as, if not more, important than data from large managers as noted in discussions with TagniFi, a provider of data and analytics. Chad Sandstedt, TagniFi co-Founder and CEO, pointed out, “Most of the value in this [13F] data is from the smaller managers since that is where the interesting active strategies are. Many of the larger managers are passive or closet indexers so the value is diminished with this group. Also, if the dataset becomes exclusive to the largest 10% of managers, it is mostly going to include data on the S&P 500 as those managers typ ically do not own anything smaller than that due to their size. ” We also agree with the many investors and corporations that have already responded to this proposal, and that attest to the value and need for 13F reported data from investment managers, regardless of size. Data quality considerations and other amendments Question 25: Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? … Should we consider omitting the Form 13F requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why n ot? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial ef fect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? We ask the Commission to consider other approaches that would reduce the burden on 13F filers, both large and small, and which could also serve to improve the quality of 13F data reported. In 2010, the SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report1 noting problems it had identified in 13F filings. In its report, the OIG stated that because there was no consistent monitoring or validation checks built into the EDGAR System to catch potential problems, many Forms 13Fs were filed with errors, which were not detected or corrected in a timely manner. The report also pointed out that the then current text file format of Form 13F, limited the ability to extract, organize and analyze the da ta being reported. After this report was published, the SEC began requiring 13F filers to prepare their submissions in a custom XML schema, presumably to address the issues raised by the OIG. A review of 13F data shows that filers have been submitting d ata to EDGAR using a custom XML schema since 2013. Despite this move, quality issues continue to plague 13F filings. 1 SEC OIG Review of the SEC’s Section 13F Reporting Requirements: https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf Page 3 of 4 A 2016 study titled Form 13F (Mis)Filings2, jointly written by Anne M. Anderson, Associate Professor of Finance and Paul Brockman, Profes sor of Finance, at Lehigh University, identified a high frequency of incorrect pricing data and substantial variation across individual reporting firms. Their conclusion notes “It is far too easy for investors and researchers to be lulled into a false sens e of security with respect to data integrity by relying on reputable, third -party data providers when obtaining institutional holdings’ figures. Our study suggests that the SEC’s methods of data collection and monitoring would require significant improveme nts before such reliance is warranted.“ A recent review of 13F data conducted by XBRL US, found that many CUSIP numbers are entered incorrectly. Data quality issues that we see related to use of the CUSIP can be improved by performing simple CUSIP checks um validation at the time of filing. By moving towards nonproprietary securities identifiers, the scope for validation by third parties is vastly improved by allowing database comparison which is expensive with proprietary identifiers like C USIP. We have also identified scaling errors in the data, which could be improved upon by a move to XBRL -CSV which supports robust validation by the filer and by the SEC. Transition 13F filers to nonproprietary securities identifiers Require registran ts to use an open, nonproprietary securities identifier like the FIGI, which is a flexible identifier that catalogs financial instruments across global asset classes. The FIGI is a 12 - character, alphanumeric, randomly generated identifier that covers hundreds of millions of securities worldwide. The FIGI has a unique identifier that is specific to a given security. The CUSIP, which is now required for 13F reporting, can change for many reasons, including a simple name change. The b ase of the CUSIP is meant to represent a single issuer but because of the code structure, it is possible for a single issuer to have multiple base codes. If the name of the issuer changes, the base code (s) will be changed, resulting in the CUSIPs for ever y associated security to change as well. In addition, a “mature” CUSIP can be re -used over time. This can lead to confusion and data quality issues. The FIGI does not change over time and because it can be mapped to other identifiers, it can aid in tracking o ther identifiers that may be used to represent the same financial instrument. In addition, CUSIP does not cover every instrument type, for example options, which results in these securities being covered by the CUSIP of the listed equity which is not an a ccurate representation. These complexities inevitably lead to data quality problems, lack of traceability, and the inability to conduct effective oversight and analysis. Although the CUSIP is common in the United States, it has not been adopted widely outs ide of the U.S. and Canada, because of the associated royalty and data fees that come with distribution of the CUSIP. 2 Form 13F (Mis) Filings, October 15, 2016: https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/08/08/form -13f-mis-filings/ Page 4 of 4 A transition to a nonproprietary identifier would improve the quality and traceability of the data, and even more importantly, reduce costs throughout the reporting supply chain. An open source identifier like the FIGI can be freely used and distributed wi thout paying any fees. It would reduce the burden on both investment managers preparing the filing, and on users consuming the 13F data. Consider s witch ing from the current custom XML schema to XBRL CSV We ask the Commission to consider the XBRL -CSV format for reporting 13F data rather than using a custom XML schema, as filers do today. A move to XBRL -CSV would simplify 13F filings. With XBRL -CSV, registrants could prepare their 13F filing in spreadsheets which is likely how many prepare this information today. With XBRL -CSV, files can be validated for accuracy against a base schema defined in an XBRL Taxonomy. Fund managers would only require access to a spreadsheet to file their 13F data and could avoid having to put the data in an XML format. The added benefit of this approach is that the XBRL generated data would be easier to consume than the current XML -formatted files and could be accomplished using any XBRL -enabled application. With the current XML files, providers of analytical and data base applications must first tailor their tool to understand the custom XML schema , in order to automate data extraction. That step would not be necessary with XBRL. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the SEC proposal regarding the disclosure threshold for 13F filers, and on other ways to reduce the burden on filers and improve the quality of the data they produce. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue further. Please feel free to contact me i f you have any follow up questions or would like to discuss.

File Number S7 - 08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: The American Bankers Association 1(ABA), jointly with CUSIP Global Services 2(CGS), appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Securit ies and Exchange Commission’s (Commission or SEC) proposed rule amending the requirem ents for Form 13F reported by institutional investment managers. Specifically, we address Item 25 under the list of issues requesting comments: 25. Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13F’s requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or wh y not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Background ABA comments as owner of the CUSIP identification system; CGS as operator of the same under contract by S&P Global Market Intelligence with the ABA. In 1964, as a response to the securities 1 The American Bankers Association is the voice of the nation’s $20.3 trillion banking industry, which is comprised of small, regional, and large banks that together employ more than 2 million people, safeguard $15.8 trillion in deposits, and extend nearly $11 trillion in loans. Learn more at www.aba.com 2 The financial services industry relies on CGS’ unrivaled experience in uniquely identifying instruments and entities to support efficient global capital markets. Its extensive focus on standardization over the past 50 years has helped CGS earn its reputa tion as a trusted originator of quality identifiers and descriptive data, ensuring that essential front - and back -office functions run smoothly. CGS is managed on behalf of the American Bankers Association (ABA) by S&P Global Market Intelligence, with a B oard of Trustees that represents the voices of leading financial institutions. For more information, visit www.cusip.com settlement “paper crunch,” the NY Clearing House Association approached the ABA to develop a more efficient system for the trading, clearing, and settlement of securities. Thus was the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures – C USIP – born, with the first directory being published in 19683. In the ensuing decades, in parallel with widespread adoption and implementation by market participants, an increasing number of clearing corporations, regulators, and market authorities came to recognize the value and reliability of the CUSIP system . Under the direction and guidance of a cross - industry senior group of experts, the C USIP Board of Trustees, this led to an ever -expanding universe of asset classes supported by CUSIP identifiers : municipal bonds, commercial paper, US treasury bonds, mortgage -backed securities, and bankers acceptances to name just a few. Over 50 years later, that spirit of innovation, sustained investment, and commitment to powerin g efficient capital markets lives on. Form 13F Since the introduction of Section 13 (f)(3) of the Exchange Act in 1978, the Commission has been responsible for publishing an official list of securities that must be reported pursuant to Section 13 (f)(1). Form 13F requires disclosure of the name and address of the institutional investment manager filing the report and, for each security being reported, specific information, including the name of the issuer, the class, the CUSIP identifier, the number of shares or principal amount, and the aggregate fair market value. The use of CUSIP identifiers within Form 13F has helped foster market transparency for investors by ensuring uniformity across investment managers reporting their holdings. For example, the CUSIP for Microsoft Common Stock is 594918 10 4: all investment managers meeting the threshold for Form 13F and owning Microsoft shares use that CUSIP when reporting. This consistent format for reporting has proved both simple and re liable for institution al investment managers and investors alike. Derivatives Holdings We are aware that o ther respondents to the proposed rule change may challenge the proven soundness of the current Form 13F requirements by pointing out a long- standing practice of reporting investment managers: I n cases where their holding is a derivative, such as an equity option, investment managers will frequently report using the underlying CUSIP. For example, if a holding is 1000 call options on Microsoft stock with a given expiry date, the reporting investment mana ger often reverts to CUSIP 594918 10 4 in Form 13F, even though a call option is a distinct financial instrument from the common stock. While this long- standing practice has never in our experience been cause for concern, it is also easily addressed: valid CUSIPs are available for all listed option contracts traded on US exchanges, including index, equity, and ETF options. ABA/CGS would gladly work with the Commission to add these CUSIPs to the published list of reportable securities as necessary . 3 “…The CUSIP system represents the foundation of the program to improve the speed and accuracy in the processing of securities and transactions involving them. We urge you to build upon that foundation as quickly as possible and again congratulate all of the organizations and individuals who participated in the development of the CUSIP system for th eir noteworthy achievement.” – SEC Chairman Hamer Budge, June 20th 1969 Additional Identifiers Item 25 seeks comments on the proposed use of additional identifiers in Form 13F , specifically mentioning the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI). The FIGI is a product of Bloomberg LP, a global software, financial, data, and media company. We submit that t he use of additional identifiers such as FIGI could prove extremely disruptive to Form 13F reporting and market participants by extension for two primary reasons: 1. Consistency across reporting investment managers As noted, the soundness and transparency offered by the current Form 13F requirements depend on all institutional investment managers reporting their holdings in a uniform fashion. Returning to the example of Microsoft Common Stock with CUSIP 594918 10 4, one of the relevant FIGIs is BBG000BPH459 . If two different investment managers were to report using the different identifiers, the transparency and consistency of Form 13F is quickly lost for all market participants, especially when the difference is compounded over thousands of reportable holdings. 2. Fungibility One of the hallmarks of the CUSIP system is the critical, industry -driven notion of fungibility: simply put, Microsoft Common Stock is the same instrument for the purpose of unique identification regardless of the venue of execution . As such, all reporting investment managers know that holdings of Microsoft are to be submitted with the CUSI P 594918 10 4. With other identification schemas, including FIGI, a different method is employed: as indicated in the example above, there are multiple identifiers for the same common stock depending on the US Exchange where the shares are purchased . The various FIGIs for Microsoft Common Stock, for example, include: BBG000BPH9J3 BBG000BPH459 BBG000BPH6D5 BBG000BPH654 BBG000BPH958 BBG000BPHG07 BBG000BPHD40 BBG000BPH583 BBG000BPH8J5 BBG000BPH4R5 Therefore, if one investment manager purchased Microsoft shares on the NASDAQ main market and another purchased Microsoft shares on the NASDAQ PHLX (Philadelphia) market, they could report using two different FIGI identifiers in their respective Forms 13F even while using the same identification schema. This multiplicity of identifiers is a feature of the FIGI system and would likely lead to inefficiency and errors in the reporting and monitoring of investments under management, thus undermining the very purpose of Form 13F. Summ ary Since the implementation of the Form 13F requirements over forty years ago, the format has served the Commission, investment managers, and the investor community well, providing unquestionable consistency and transparency . The universal acceptance of the CUSIP system due to its efficacy is well established. This is not the case for FIGI. The introduction of a second identifier, even if optional for investment managers, would introduce unnecessary ambiguity and confusion for the reasons set forth above while also adding an unknown cost burden stemming from identifier in consistency Resp ectfully, _______________________ Tab Ti mothy Stewart Senior Vice President, Financial Services Standards American Bankers Association _________________________ Scott J .

This letter represents the views of CCR and not necessarily the views of FEI or its members individually. The size and structure of the U.S. equities market h as changed significantly in the 45 years since the Form 13F reporting threshold was last updated . Thus , CCR understands the rationale for the Commission’s proposal and appreciates the intent to reduce reporting costs for small er investment managers. However, CCR is concerned that increasing the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion will significant ly reduce transparency to the ownership of public companies and hamper engagement with shareholder s. Information about shareholder composition is critical for public companies to effectively engage with, provide relevant information to, and address the needs of their shareholders. Public companies rely on both Form 13F and Schedule 13D filings to provide reliable quality information about their shareholder composition. Because Schedule 13 D is filed only by shareh olders with greater than 5 percent ownership of a voting class of a company’s equity securities, public companies rely most heavily on quarterly Form 13F filings to gather the ownership information of smaller shareholders who se needs may otherwise be overl ooked. 2 Although CCR recognizes that the reporting threshold for Form 13 F may deserve reconsideration after 45 years, CCR does not believe t he proposed reporting threshold increase is appropriate. A reporting threshold of $3.5 billion would eliminate 89.2 percent of current Form 13F filers and leave public companies with no other regulated mechanism to identify these shareholders . Therefore , CCR does not believe that the estimated cost savings described in the proposal justify the loss of reliable and high -quality shareholder information . However, if the SEC determines that updating the threshold is nec essary, CCR suggests a more measured approach that takes into consideration the impact of the reporting threshold increase on public companies ’ ability to engage with shareholders of all sizes .

(NYSE: ECL) , a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services headquartered in Saint Paul, Minnesota , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would discontinue reporting by 89 percent of current 13F filers, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair our engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long-term investors and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our company . The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers . While 13F data is not nearly as timely as it should be in this digital age, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This informat ion cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company. As a large cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to accurately identify our shareholders and engage effectively with them. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , a number of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the smaller active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable . 2 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Smaller shareholders, such as those that fall below the $3.5B threshold, do not have the same access to resources and information flow as the large firms, nor generate the payment flow to brokers and information providers of the hedge funds for such information, and it is only by identifying those holders through the 13F data that we are able to proactively engage them regarding our company’s business and outlook. This imbalance is exacerbated by brokerage firms prioritizing their investment advisor accounts (and thereby services ren dered) by size and revenue volume . Further, m any investors do not reach out to us before or after investing. For us to provide proactive engagement with them regarding governance and financial updates, 13F data is critical. For example, we just completed our governance outreach calls to shareholders in the proxy off- season to explore whether the holders have governance issues they wish to discuss when they have more time available. We use the 13F data to determine who we will call as part of these efforts. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic. Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those ac tivist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions and who may use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long - term shareholders. Understanding our investor base is critical to our efforts to dev elop long term holders who focus on long term returns and business growth, rather than hedge funds that value short term actions for quick gains at the expense of legitimate long -term business development. The proposal benefits t he very parties that impede the development of sustainable business growth. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we take measures that may not be part of a successful long -term business strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism , as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. Many corpo rate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 1 3D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. 3 While we agree the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impact s of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors and detect potential activists would far outweigh the extremely modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies, the adjustments to the transition thresholds for compan ies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status and the updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions. For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by NAM, National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance and Nasdaq . Rather than reduc e 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote much more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions and significantly cutting the 45-day reporting period .

As a p ublic company since 2004 with a $40 billion market cap italization , what our company need s in order to best meet our obligations to our shareholder s is more market transparency —not less. That is why we forcefully oppose the Commission’s proposed amendment to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. Simply put, the current proposal is not the modernization we need ; in fact, it’s the opposite of the reform we’ve been supporting for years . As a large -cap company, w e estimate that the proposed $3.5 billion threshold would allow 59% of our current 13F filers to ev ade disclosure.1 This change, if enacted, would significantly undermine Digital Realty’s understanding of our investors , and how we interact with them . Specifically, it would hinder our existing engagement with shareholder s, which help s to keep us informed as to the issues our share holders care about and enable us to maintain constructive dialogue with those investors and with the broader marketplace . The amendment would also impede our ability to attract new long -term investors2 and d eprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds. These effects would be particularly unwelcome during a period of economic uncertainty when short sell ers and activist hedge funds have the potential to unfairly take advantage of companies with otherwise solid performance track record s and strong fundamentals. 1) We understand that the effects of the proposed amendments would be even more pronounced for small and mid -cap companies. Make no mistake, the impact on large -cap companies will be significant. 2) Under the current rules, we can safely say that any investor that is not required to file under 13F is too small to take on a large long -term position, but if the proposed changes are enacted, we will no longer be able to say that with any confidence. This would put small long -only mutual and hedge fund managers a t a serious disadvantage. John J. Stewart , CFA Senior Vice President Investor Relations Digital Realty Four Embarcadero Center, Suite 3200 San Francisco, CA 94111 USA Tel: +1 415 738 6500 Fax: +1 415 738 6501 www.digitalrealty.com 2 13F data is the only tool available to public companies that shows us which investors are buying or selling shares each quarter . Schedule 13D and 13G reports are not a sufficient alternative because reliance on these reports alone would leave us blind to most ownership changes , given that only four of our shareholders own five percent or more of Digital Realty stock. It would also leave us blind to certain investors who refuse to disclose their stakes —even activists who have raised questions about the company, requested meetings with our management, and/or launched an activist campaign . While it is true that activists falling below the prop osed threshold would be inherently less impactful in terms of their ownership stake, it’s equally true that those activists would have the ability to make noise and manipulate share price behind a veil of secrecy , putting companies at even greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriented fund managers. To be clear, Digital Realty welcomes the views of all shareholders and is not seeking any protections from activist approaches. In fact, quite the contrary – in order to be able to engage with shareholders potentially seeking change, we must be able to kn ow t hat t hey own our shares. Our goal is to communicate with our holders as much as we can, and to be as transparent with them as we can. We know that the SEC, with your mandate to protect investors and ensure good disclosure from public companies, share s this goal, as do advocates of good corporate governance. Rather than raising the threshold and reducing transparency , the reform we need is more robust short sale disclosures and timelier disclosures . Specifically, we urge the Commission to require 13F filers to disclose short and derivative positions, shorten the antiquated 45-day reporting period , and support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure. These reforms would not only fortify public companies’ ability to effectively engage with shareholders, but also give small retail investors visibility when sophisticated investors are actively betting against a stock. These reforms are long overdue , as it’s now been a decade since Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 rightfully called for monthly disclosure of short positions . An example from the not -too-distant past shows the impact that a single investor can have on the market, a nd why real reform is needed to bolster —not diminish —13F disclosures. In 2013, our stock was trading at $69 per share when an activist short seller told investors at a conference t hat Digital Realty was a “melting ice cube” and our shares were only worth $20 per share because our “dividend [was] not sustainable” and our “fundamentals [were] deteriorating.” These comments followed a period when the short seller had been engaging with ou r investor relations team under false pretenses and, unbeknownst to us, accruing a short position. For a time, the comments had a significant downward impact on our share price, which dropped by more than 20% over the next year. John J.

Today —despite the short seller’s grim predictions based on mischaracterizations and inaccurate conclusions —Digital Realty shares are trading at over $140 per share. For the reasons stated above and in light of the concerns expressed by countless individual shareholders and public companies that help fuel our economy , we urge the Commission to withdraw its proposed 13F amendments . Instead , we respectfully encourage the Commission to adopt the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq.3 Sincerely , John J.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman: The National Association of Manufacturers appreciates the opportunity to provide comment to the Securities and Exchange Commission on File No. S7 -08-20, the Commission’s proposed rule to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutio nal investment managers.1 The NAM is the largest manufacturing trade association in the United States, representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states . These businesses often turn to the public market to finance the significant investments in equipment and research necessary fo r modern manufacturing. Thus, a vibrant public market that supports capital formation and long -term growth is critical to th e sustained success of manufacturing in America . Manufacturers kno w that a central factor to their success as publicly traded companies is a consistent, transparent dialogue with their shareholders that enables smart business growth and strong investor returns. The information provided by asset managers via Form 13F filings is the only reliable source of information that public companies have about their shareholders.2 Data from Form 13F is the linchpin of manufacturers’ investor relations programs, and without t his critical information manufacturers’ efforts to understand and communicate with shareholders would be substantially curtailed. As such, the NAM is extremely concerned that the SEC has proposed to severely limit the availability of Form 13F information. By increasing the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, the proposed rule would exempt 89% of current 13F filers from the disclosure requirement — drastically limiting public ly traded manufacturers’ visibility into their shareholder base and undercutting vital shareholder outreach, communication, and education efforts. Moreover, the proposed rule would have a disproportionate impact on small businesses , which are more likely to be held by smaller institutions and thus to lose information about a higher percentage of their existing Form 13F filers . 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , 85 Fed. Reg. 46016 (31 July 2020 ). Release No. 34- 89290 , available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf . 2 The NAM strongly supports amendments to the SEC’s NOBO -OBO rules so that Form 13F filings would no longer be the sole source of information about issuers’ beneficial owners. We commend the SEC’s ongo ing efforts to reform the proxy process, and manufacturers believe that NOBO -OBO reform is a critical facet of the Commission’s work to modernize the “proxy plumbing” underpinning the U.S. proxy system. However, the potential for NOBO -OBO reform in the fut ure does not mitigate the impact that the proposed 13F rule would have in the present. The NAM encourages the SEC to preserve companies’ existing ability to understand their shareholder base by reconsidering its 13F rule proposal and , later, to enhance sha reholder transparency via commonsense NOBO -OBO reform. 2 At a fundamental level, companies should know who their shareholders are so that management can be responsive and responsible to the ultimate owners of the business . Form 13F filings enable this crucial relationship . The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to reconsider, and ultimately to withdraw, its proposed rule to substantially reduce the utility of Form 13F information . The proposing release claims that the rule would modernize and update Form 13F in order to achieve minor cost savings for some asset managers . Unfortunately , the full impact would be a significa nt reduction in market transparency and a loss of vital information upon which businesses and shareholders depend to facilitate fair and efficient markets in the United States. I. Impact of the Proposed Rule on Corporate Uses of Form 13F Data The report on the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 issued by the Senate Banking Committee3 makes clear that Congress sought to grant companies more information about their shareholders when enacting Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act: Related to the need for disclosure by institutional investment managers of their securities holdings and transactions is the need for the management of individual companies to be able to identify the holders of their stock. Institutional investment managers have customarily used nominees, officers and employees of the institutions to hold legal title in “street name” to stock certificates to allow the institution greatest flexibility in transferring the stock certificates. This practice may impede company management in its attemp ts to communicate directly with the beneficial owners of its securities.4 Congress clearly considered the importance of transparency for issuers in a general sense (“the need for the management of individual companies to be able to identify the holders of their stock ”) and the specific uses to which a compan y might put Form 13F data (“to communicate directly with the beneficial owners of its securities”). The report describes a status quo where businesses were blind to the holders of their stock as an “extra layer of unnecessary secrecy” and underscores the Banking Committee’s belief that the Section 13(f)(1) disclosure regime would be “a carefully drawn response to the problem.”5 In proposing a 3500% increase in the Form 13F disclosure threshold, the SEC acknowledges that the proposed rule “would decrease holdings data available to …corporate issuers ”6 that might be “interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock.”7 This understates the importance of 13F information to publicly traded companies and fails to appropriately consider the impact of the proposed rule on issuers and their outreach to shareholders . Notably, the proposing release queries whether “any of these Form 13F data users find the data from smaller managers to be valuable”8 given that, in the Commission ’s view, the information’s importance “would depend on their particular use of this data.”9 There are myriad uses to which public companies put Form 13F dat a, and for publicly traded manufacturers of all sizes these uses are more universal than particular . The wide range of 3 S. Report No. 94 -75, to accompany S. 249: Securities Acts Amendments of 1975. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 94th Congress, 1st Session (14 April 1975). 4 Id. at 80. 5 Id. at 81. 6 Proposing Release, supra note 1, at 23. 7 Id. at 22. 8 Id. at 23. 9 Id. at 24. 3 contemporary use cases for Form 13F data combined with Congress’s unambiguous legislative intent in enacting Section 13(f)(1) make clear that increased transparency into public company shareholders is a core feature of the 13F disclosure requirement. These are not “particular uses” that have built up around a disclosure regime intended for a separate purpose; rather, Form 13F data was intended to be and has fully become a critical tool for public companies to understand and communicate with their shareholders. A. Communicati ng with Shareholders At the most basic level, Form 13F filings provide issuers with a list of the identities of the ir shareholders . This list is the foundation of public companies’ day -to-day investor relations efforts . Investor relations activity is centered on consistent communication with a business’s shareholders, and it is impossible to communicate with shareholders if company management is blind to their identities . There is no way to conduct effective shareholder outreach without a base of knowledge about the shareholders themselves —and effective shareholder outreach is critical to a w ell- functioning public company . Publicly traded manufacturers meet with a cross -section of their shareholders on a regular basis, both via scheduled outreach from the company and in response to meeting requests from shareholders. Knowing who their investors are and understanding more about them (as discussed in more detail below) enables businesses to schedule these meetings, staff them appropriately, and effectively manage limited time and resources. The SEC has traditionally sup ported enhanced transparency and encouraged the vital investor - management dialogue that supports the public company model . Consistent communication between issuers and shareholders enhances long-term value creation , and Form 13F filings enable these critical relationships. However, the proposed rule would exempt 89% of current filers from the reporting requirement, limit ing communication and undercu tting important engagement opportunities. B. Analy zing Shareholders’ Holdings Form 13F filings provide for a deeper level of analysis beyond a simple list of names. Knowing how large an investor’s position is, when they first purchased shares, and whether their holdings have increased or decreased helps companies better understand their shareholders and the relative significance of their holdings —both to the company and to the investor. Businesses are quick to reach out if they identify a new investor upon reviewing quarterly 13F data in order to welcome them to the com pany and to better appreciate their goals in holding stock. Significant increases or decreases in holdings from current shareholders necessitate similar outreach in order to address any concerns and clari fy how the company fits into the shareholder’s evolving portfolio . Information about s maller asset managers (i. e., those likely to be excluded from the Form 13F filing requirement under the proposed rule) is crucial for these purposes. Businesses are unlikely to have as much information about smaller institutions , and the se investors’ holdings are more likely to fluctuate than those of larger index funds —but 13F provides vital data on who these investors are and how their holdings have changed. This information gives issuers an opportunity to conduct critical outreach to these importan t shareholders , who in turn disproportionately benefit from tailored company communications. These opportunities would all but vanish under the proposed rule given its focus on only the largest asset managers . 4 C. Understanding Shareholders’ Portfolios Form 13F allows for t ransparency into shareholders’ portfolios beyond their investment in a given business , enabling companies to understand more about shareholders ’ investing strategies and ensure that communications with them are as tailored and effective as possible. For example, Form 13F data might reveal valuable information about a shareholder’s exposure to a certain industry, their investing goals and time horizons, or their priorities on key governance issues. Is the shareholder primarily pursuing growth , value , income, or other targets in their investments? Are their holdings centered on a specific industry, or i s their portfolio m ore diverse? Does their position in the business represent a sizeable share of their portfolio , or is it less significant ? Is there a specific focus on type, size, or location of company ? Are the ir holdings consistent quarter -to- quarter and year -to-year or are there significant changes in the portfolio makeup? These insights allow a business to understand how it fits i nto a given shareholder’s portfolio and to tailor its outreach accordingly —resulting in more productive, meaningful conversations with investors. They also allow business es to understand their shareholder base as a whole, providing a greater understand ing of the market’s view of the business’s value and prospects , notable trends in the makeup of their sharehold er base, and benchmark data compared to industry peers. The proposed 13F reporting regime , focused as it is only on the largest institutions , would significantly limit these important uses of Form 13F data for all publicly traded companies —and particularly for smaller businesses (which are more likely to be held by asset managers that fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold) . D. Identifying Potential Investors Information from Form 13F is valuable for companies to identify and track potential new investors. Knowledge about an investor’s industry focus or growth goals can lead to proactive outreach and productive conversations about how a business might enhance their portfolio. For companies of all sizes, including smaller businesses in need of growth capital, this information can be critical. Functions enabled and enhanced by Form 13F data include b uilding out a series of meetings for a non -deal roadshow, planning management travel (or knowing who to reach out to in a given city if management is already on the road), and scheduling presentations at business development and partnering events . Similarly, Form 13F information is useful for business es considering M&A activity or partnership opportunities , allowing them to understand the differences between their and a potential partner’s shareholder s and to identify any notable overlap. Identifying n ew investors and understanding M&A/partnership opportunities are critical to capital formation for all public companies , and for small businesses in particular . The information made available by Form 13F is the best (and in many cases, only) way for small businesses to approach these op portunities in a targeted manner that is most likely to grow their business and their shareholder base . E. Responding to Activists Quarterly Form 13F reports grant businesses insights into activist investors that take a position in their stock and give them valuable time to consider how best to respond to potential activist activity. Though 13F filings are published well after the end of the quarter (up to 135 days after an activist first buys stock if they purchase on the first day of the quarter), they are still often the first signal a business receives that an activist has built a position in the company ’s stock . 5 In addition to the obvious ( identifying the activist’s identity ), the information on Form 13F also allows issuers to do further research on other companies in which the activist has or has had a position and what, if any, asks they may have made of those businesses. With a more fulsome understanding of the activist’s probable goals, an issuer can reach out directly to th em and begin a conversation to hear their perspectives on the business and discuss how best to address any concerns they may have. Alternatively, the business can use 13F data to begin proactive outreach to the rest of its shareholder base —a valuable opportunity to share management’s perspectives on the activist ’s goals and work with the full base of long -term investors to agree on the best path forward for the business. The proposed rule would exempt m any well -known activists from the Form 13F disclosure requirement , leaving companies unable to respond if targeted. The infrequent and delayed nature of 13F filings already limits issuers’ ability to respond to activists , and eliminating their disclosure obligations entirely would leave companies flying blind in the event of activist activity. F. Navigating Proxy Season Robust communication with shareholders takes on increased import ance during proxy season. The SEC recently instituted long-awaited reforms that will reduce the outsized influence of proxy advisory firms and political activists during proxy season, but making Form 13F data less robust could undercut these improvements to the proxy process by mak ing it more difficult to communicate with long-term shareholders . Communication with shareholders about routine proxy ballot questions is a standard feature of publicly traded companies’ investor relations programs. Helping investors to understand management ’s perspectives on the proposals up for a shareholder vote enables informed decision - making by shareholders on a wide range of important issues . If conversations before proxy season (enabled by information found in 13F filings) helped a business understand a given investor’s governance priorities, outreach during proxy season (also enabled by information found in 13F filings) can ensure that they are comfortable with how those priorities are address ed on the proxy ballot. Notably, t his outreach is important for investors up and down the cap italization table , as in many cases a business is required to meet certain quorum requirements or achieve a certain percentage of outstanding shares (rather than vot es cast) for a proposal to pass —so interaction beyond the top holders is critical.10 For contentious proxy ballot questions, these communications are even more essential. A deep understanding of the full shareholder base allows companies to reach out quickly if they receive an adverse recommendation from a proxy advisory firm. At present, there is no standardized way to share with investors management’s response to an adverse proxy firm recommendation without outreach enabled by Form 13F. Once the new rule requiring proxy advisory firms to notify their clients when companies file a response to a recommendation goes into effect , investors will finally have an opportunity to compare the proxy firm’s and the company’s perspectives —but the robust communication strategies enabled by Form 13F information will still be critical to educating shareholders within the tight timeframes of proxy season . The NAM strongly supported both recent proxy rules,11 which were designed to prioritize the ne eds of long -term shareholders above those of unaccountable third parties like proxy advisory firms and 10 The proposed rule, of course, would eliminate transparency into all but the largest shareholders —making these vote thresholds even harder to meet. 11 See, e.g., NAM Comments on File No. S7-22-19 (available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -22-19/s72219 - 6735396 -207626.pdf ) and NAM Comments on File No. S7 -23-19 (available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -23- 19/s72319 -6735509 -207647.pdf ). 6 single -issue activists. It is therefore critical that businesses remain able to communicate directly with their shareholders —else we risk returning to a status quo dominated by intermediaries and plagued with inaccurate or politically motivated information that does not address long -term shareholders’ priorities and to which businesses are unable to respond. Form 13F enables companies to understand their s hareholders’ goals and to communicate directly with them during proxy season, both critical checks on the power of proxy advisory firms and political activists. The NAM appreciates the SEC’s recent efforts to focus the proxy conversation on the financial wellbeing of long -term investors, and we encourage the Commission to maintain the availability of robust Form 13F data that enables the very conversations that form the basis of a health y, productive proxy season . II. Impact of the Proposed Rule on Investor Uses of Form 13F Data As discussed, Form 13F enables vital shareholder -management dialogue that benefits investors and issuers alike. A deep understanding of the holders of a company’s stock is critical to targeted outreach and tailored conversations —both of which allow shareholders to better understand the business and have their voice s heard as owner s. Beyond these important conversations with the companies in which they hold shares, investors also use Form 13F information to determine whether to make or adjust an investment in a company. Knowledge gleaned from 13F analysis is key to understanding how the market views a given issuer and ho w the company might fit into an investor’s portfolio. The 1975 Senate Report makes clear that Congress had investors in mind in enacting Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act. The Report states: Perhaps the most important justification for the information collection program which this bill would authorize is the need to collect and disseminate to individual investors data about institutional investment managers. Many people believe that it is not possible to make informed investment decisions on a security without information related to the likely market activity and the degree of institutional concentration in the security.12 The significant reduction in transparency associated with the proposed rule would deprive investors of the very information “related to the likely market activity and the degree of institutional concentration” that Congress intended when authorizing the SEC to collect Form 13F data. Without this information, investor s would face barriers to identif ying institutional concentration, assess ing market liquidity, and compar ing investment options. The increase in the institutional ownership of American stocks over the past several decades underscores this point. Institutions own nearly 80% of equity market value in the United States,13 so understanding their holdings is now more important than ever. As the legislative history makes clear, 13F information is intended to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of our securities markets”14—a commendable standard, and one which the proposed rule would fail to meet. 12 1975 Senate Report, supra note 3 , at 82. 13 McGrath, Charles. 80% of equity market cap held by institutions . Pensions & Investments, 25 April 2017. Available at http://www.pionline.com/article/20170425/INTERACTIVE/170429926/80 -of-equity -market -cap-held-by-institutions . 14 1975 Senate Report, supra note 3, at 82. 7 III. Significant Reductions in Transparency As noted in the proposing release, 5,089 institutional investment managers currently file Form 13F reports. If the rule were to be finalized as proposed, only 550 managers would be required to file Form 13F —an 89% de crease.15 This significant drop would have a direct impact on public companies’ ability to identify their shareholders and communicate effectively with them. Conversations with NAM members about the impact of the proposed rule illuminate the challenges they would face if the proposed rule were finalized as proposed : • A Fortune 250 company in the automotive industry reports that 4 3% of its current Form 13F filers manage less than $3.5 billion in assets, including 1 3% of its top 100 shareholders and 12% of its top 50 shareholders. • A mid -cap company in the electronics industry reports that 67% of its current Form 13F filers would fall below the proposed threshold, leaving just 240 institutions into which it would have visibility. • A Fortune 250 com pany in the chemical manufacturing industry would experience a 68% reduction in Form 13F filers under the proposed rule. • A small -cap company in the automotive industry would lose information on 60% of its current Form 13F filers. • A Fortune 250 company in the industrial manufacturing industry would lose visibility into nearly 700 of its current Form 13F filers, a 60% decrease. • A small -cap company in the transportation industry would experience a nearly 40% decrease in shareholder vi sibility , including a loss of information about a quarter of its top 20 shareholders . • A Fortune 250 company in the food industry would lose access to information on 10% of its top 200 investors and 60% of its Form 13F filers overall. • A Fortune 500 company in the technology industry would experience a 60% decline in the number of report ing shareholders. These anecdotal perspectives align with the 89% drop in Form 13F filers that the SEC expects, illustrat ing the breadth and depth of the rule’s impact. Companies of all sizes would lose v ital information, including in many cases data about a significant portion of their major shareholders. As discussed, this reduction in transparency would have far -reaching eff ects and would significantly hamper shareholder outreach efforts at businesses across the country. A 3500% increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold would limit the usability of 13F data and undercut Congress’s goal of providing information about institutional investors to businesses and the public. The Commission has identifie d the primary benefit of the rule as regulatory relief for smaller asset managers . The proposing release estimates that institutions no longer required to file a Form 13F might save $1 5,000 to $30,000 annually .16 These relatively minor benefits pale in comparison to the significant costs of the proposal —namely, the harm to issuers and investors brought on by reduced transparency and diminished shareholder -management engagement. Technology has made compiling Form 13F data straightforward and relatively inexpensive for most asset managers , so the impact of the loss of Form 13F data far outweighs the cost and time savings that would accrue to asset managers under the proposed rule . The NAM is hopeful that the SEC’s review of business and shareholder responses to the proposal will illuminate the considerable consequences of finalizing the rule and lead the Commission to reconsider the cost -benefit analysis underpinning the proposal. Limited cost savings do not justify a dramatic upheaval in the only reliable method by which businesses can access information about their shareholders. 15 Proposing Release, supra note 1, at 17. 16 Id. at 18. 8 IV. The SEC’s Authority to Increase the Form 13F Reporting Threshold A. Implementing Authority Section 13(f) (1) of the Exchange Act states that institutional investment managers with assets under management “of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine ”17 must file reports pursuant to the section. The proposing release asserts that Section 13(f)(1) grants the SEC the authority to raise or lower the $100 million threshold, but the plain language of the statute says otherwise. Section 13(f)(1) grants the SEC clear authority to lower the threshold ( as long as it remains above $10 million) while specifically denying the authority to raise it.18 The statute creates a reporting regime wherein institutions with assets under management totaling $100 million must report pursuant to the section while allowing the Commission to set a lower threshold by rule. Section 13(f)(1) does not say that the reporting threshold must be “at least ” $100 million (as the proposing release implies) ; it says that an asset manager’s holdings must be “at least” equal to the threshold to trigger reporting —and that the threshold itself can only be $100 million or “such lesser amount” set by the SEC . Put more clearly, th e SEC could set a threshold of $9 9 million, or $30 million, or $11 million —but not $101 million, or $200 million, or $3.5 billion. The proposing release notes that the 1975 Senate Report says the Commission “would have authority to raise or lower the jurisdictional amount from $100 million”19—but, critically, the Senate bill on which the report was issued differed from the final version approved by Congress. Section 13(f)(1) as included in the Senate bill would have require d institutions to file if their assets under management equal ed “at least $100,000,000 or such other amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine.”20 The enacted bill, as discusse d, requires disclosure at a level of “at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount .” Congress considered granting the SEC broad authority to raise or lower the reporting threshold, but ultimately chose to limit the Commission’s authority and only allow it to lower the threshold.21 17 15 U.S.C. 78m(f) (1). 18 The first step in statutory interpretation begins with a “plain language analysis of the statutory text. That is, we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. ” Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp. v. FERC , 372 F.3d 395, 400 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Here, “or such lesser amount” has a clear meaning , which is to grant the SEC authority to lower (and only to lower) the $100 million threshold . 19 1975 Senate Report, supra note 3, at 107. 20 Id. at 187 (emphasis added) . 21 Courts have historically ascribed legislative intent when Congress amends legislative language. See, e.g., Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 397 (1995) ( “When Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect. ”). Similar standards apply when Congress includes differentiated language in different sections of a statute. See, e.g., Russello v. United States , 464 U.S. 16 (1983) (“Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion."" ). Both principles are relevant when Congress amends a draft bill before enacting it. Furthermore, when it is clear that Congress knew how to enact a provision and chose not to, that choice carries weight. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund v. United States Dep't of Agric. , 789 F.3d 1206 (2015 ) (“Where Congress knows how to say something but chooses not to, its silence is controlling.”) ; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Beck's Estate , 129 F.2d 243 (1942 ) (“The familiar ‘easy -to-say-so-if-that-is-what -was-meant ’ rule of statutory interpretation has full force here .”). In interpreting Section 13(f)(1)’s “of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount” language , the SEC can easily look to the Senate -passed bill to determine that Congress knew how to include more expansive language (“or such other amount”) and specifically chose not to . 9 Notably, t he proposing release does not address the “or such lesser amount” language from Section 13(f)(1), appearing to rely on just a misinterpretation of the “of at least” language earlier in the clause. But “one of the most b asic interpretive canons ”22 in administrative law , the “rule against superfluities,”23 says that agencies cannot implement a statue in such a way that renders Congress’s language meaningless . In other words, agencies are prevented from tossing aside a given word, phrase, or clause in a duly enacted law if there is a plausible reading that would give effect to the full language of the statute .24 In this instance , “or such lesser amount” should be read to apply a clear upper bound on the SEC’s authority to set the Form 13F reporting threshold rather than to apply to nothing at all. (“[O]f at least ,” meanwhile, simply applies to the accumulation of an asset manager’s holdings that would trigger reporting .) Given the clear language of Section 13(f)(1) , the NAM believes that the proposed rule is inconsistent with the SEC’s implementing authority under the Exchange Act.25 B. Exemptive Authority The proposing release contends that, irrespective of the SEC’s implementing authority under Section 13(f)(1), Section 13(f)(3) grants the Commission broad exemptive authority with respect to the Form 13F reporting requirement.26 Section 13(f)(3) of the Exchange Act states that the SEC “ may exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, any institutional investment manager or security or any class of institutional investment managers or securities from any or all of the provisions of th is subsection or the rules thereunder .”27 Per the statute , other than one -off individual exemptions (for “any institutional investment manager”) , the SEC’s exemptive authority can only be exercised with respect to a cognizable “class ” of asset managers. In proposing a blanket exemption for institutions with no shared characteristics other than having assets under management between $100 million and $3.5 billion, the rule would exceed the statutory limitations o n the SEC’s exemptive authority . Furthermore , a key principle of statutory interpretation holds that agencies cannot implement a law, or authorize exemptions therefrom, in such a way as to negate or make obsolete the authorizing language .28 22 Corley v. United States , 556 U.S. 303 (2009). 23 Hibbs v. Winn , 542 U.S. 88 , 101 (2004). 24 Ibid. “A statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant .” (Quoting 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction §46.06, pp. 181-186 (rev. 6th ed. 2000) .) 25 The proposing release solicits comment on whether the Commission should increase the Form 13F reporting threshold using a different methodology than focusing on stock market growth (which resulted in the proposed $3.5 billion threshold) , suggesting consumer price inflation and stock market returns as potential alternative metrics. As discussed, the NAM does not believe the SEC has statutory authority to increase the Section 13(f)(1) threshold above $100 million. Additionally, an increase to $400 million (using the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index) or $500 million (using the Consumer Price Index ) would still impose significant limits on businesses’ ability to communicate with their shareholders, resulting in a decrease of 2,901 or 3,185 Form 13F filers, respectively. The NAM opposes on both legal and policy grounds any attempt to raise the statutory $100 million reporting threshold. 26 Proposing Release, supra note 1, at 7 . 27 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(3). 28 See, e.g., Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp. , 341 U.S. 384, 389 (1951) , which rejects a statutory interpretation in which “the exception swallows the proviso and destroys its practical effectiveness.” 10 The language in Section 13(f) is clear —the 13F reporting requirement is designed to increase transparency into the holdings of institutions with assets under management above $100 million. Section 13(f)(3) ’s exemptive authority gran ts the SEC the ability to exempt certain institutions that would otherwise be required to file —perhaps institutions in their first two years of operations, or those with fewer than 10 employees , or those that manage assets just for one famil y—by considering cross -cutting characteristics that might justify an exemption without negating the core requirement of the reporting regime.29 The SEC cannot, by contrast, issue a blanket exemption based on institutions’ assets under management given that t he $100 million reporting trigger i s central to Congress’s design of the regulation in question .30 By issuing a rule to “exempt” asset managers north of t he statutory $100 million threshold for no reason other than having assets under management below $3.5 billion (a universe of managers clearly contemplated by and included in the statutory reporting regime) , the SEC propo ses to nullify the central feature of the 13F reporting requirement as enacted by Congress . The proposed “exemption” is thus not a valid exercise of the SEC’s exemptive authority under Section 13(f)(3) . In other contexts, the SEC has sought to limit the extent to which the exercise of its exemptive authority undermines congressional intent. For example, i n adopting rules to implement the resource extraction reporting regime required by Section 13(q) of the Exchange Act ,31 the Commission declined to provide an exemption because it believed doing so “would be inconsistent with Section 13(q) and would undermine Congress ’ intent ” and that it would not be “ appropriate to adopt provisions that would frustrate, or otherwise be inconsistent with, such intent .”32,33 The NAM encourages the SEC to remain mindful of the se limits o n its exemptive authority and abandon its attempt to “ undermine ” and “ frustrate ” congressional intent as expressed in Section 13(f) . V. Reforms to Modernize Form 13F Reporting The Commission has expressed a desire to update and modernize Form 13F. The NAM agrees that the Form 13F reporting regime is out -of-date. However, significantly reducing market transparenc y is hardly the way to bring the requirement into the 21 st century. The NAM encourages the SEC to consider reforms to Form 13F and the NOBO -OBO rules that enhance transparency and provide businesses with more information about their owner s. First, the NAM would support amendments to the due dates for Form 13F reports. Quarterly filings due 45 days after the end of the quarter are a relic of a time when both trading and filing were much 29 In addition to leaving the structure of the reporting regime intact, these classifications (or others similarly construed) would represent a cognizable class, as noted a key feature of the SEC’s exemptive authority under Section 13(f)(3) . 30 As discussed above, Congress set the $100 million threshold in Section 13(f)(1) and specifically chose not to authorize the SEC to raise it. 31 Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers , 77 Fed. Reg. 56365 (12 September 2012 ). Release No. 34–67717 , available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34 -67717.pdf . 32 Id. at 202. 33 The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the 2012 resource extraction rule on Administrative Procedure Act grounds, holding that the SEC’s process in deciding not to grant an exemption was arbitrary and capricious. See API v. SEC , 953 F.Supp.2d 5 (2013). But the District Court specifically noted that it might be “ entirely reasonable for the Commission to conclude that requiring disclosure from a certain issuer or about a certain country goes to the heart of the provision's goal, and that the burden reduction [associated with an exemption] is not worth this loss ” provided the appropriate APA s tandards were met for that conclusion. With regard to the proposed 13F rule, the NAM contends that the proposed exemption “goes to the heart of the provision’s goal” and thus that the minor burden reduction for some asset managers is not worth the signific ant loss of transparency around Form 13F information. 11 less instantaneous. While public companies rely heavily on 13F data, as discussed above, it remains the case that the information is often stale by the time it reaches a business’s investor relations team. As an example, an investor buying stock on October 1 , 2020 would not need to report their new position until February 15, 2021. Significant changes in an investor’s goals, a business’s shareholder base, or the market more broadly can occur during th is four-and-a-half-month lag time , to say nothing of the potentia l for activists to intentionally take positions early in a reporting period to avoid detection while they build their holdings. The NAM supports shortening the reporting window so that businesses and investors have access to Form 13F information sooner tha n 45 days after the end of the quarter.34 The NAM would also support broadening the Form 13F reporting requirement to include information about more than just investors’ long positions. As discussed, long information is valuable to public companies, but it paints an incomplete picture of holders of in a company ’s stock. Broadening the 13F reporting requirement to include short positions would give both businesses and investors a more fulsome appreciation of the market’s view of a business and shareholders’ goals in investing in its stock. With respect to NOBO -OBO reform, the NAM believes that businesses should be able to know who their shareholders are and to communicate with them directly so that issuers can be responsive and responsible to their owners . The current NOBO -OBO rules are a significant roadblock to transparency and much -needed investor -management dialogue. The NAM would support comprehensive review of the NOBO -OBO rules in the context of the Commission’s work on proxy plumbing , with a specific emphasis on enhancing transparency between shareholders and the companies in which they invest . * * * * The importance of Form 13F data to businesses and their investors is clear —as is the impact that the proposed rule would have on shareholder -management communication that is critical to the public company model . The NAM respectfully requests that the Commi ssion withdraw the proposed rule in order to preserve the utility of Form 13F information and continue to allow public companies to conduct vital shareholder outreach and education. On behalf of the NAM and the millions of workers who make things in America, thank you for your attention to these concerns . Sincerely, Chris Netram Vice President , Tax and Domestic Economic Policy 34 We would also support congressional action to give the SEC authority to require Form 13F report ing more frequent ly than the current quarterly filing regime."
"Daniel Collins, Founder and President, WhaleWisdom",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860238-223968.pdf,,"September 29, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (File No. S7-08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: WhaleWisdom1 appreciates the opportunity to provide its views on the SEC’s proposal to update the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers, as well as make certain other changes to the Form. We are in a unique position to comment on the proposal. WhaleWisdom was built around the belief that there are significant benefits to be gained from transparency of information regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers. As such, we created an online resource for 13F-related information and have been serving a wide variety of market participants who rely on the data for a number of different uses. Adoption of the proposal will directly impact WhaleWisdom. While WhaleWisdom supports efforts by the Commission to modify rules that have placed unnecessary burdens on firms, as discussed further below, we believe that the proposal would create more harm than good. Specifically, the proposal overall is counter to the intent of the original legislation enabling Section 13(f), the proposal would reduce important transparency into the securities markets, there is no viable alternatives for the Form 13F data that would be eliminated by the proposal, and the proposed adjustments to the reporting threshold would be detrimental to ensuring confidence in our securities markets. For these reasons, we oppose adoption of the proposal. Our specific comments and recommendations follow. 1 WhaleWisdom was founded in 2008. We provide information to assist investors and other market participants to more easily navigate the information about the holdings of institutional investment managers. For more information about WhaleWisdom, visit https://whalewisdom.com/. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 2 of 10 I. Uses of 13F Data As the Release notes, since Form 13F data became publicly available, different uses for the data have developed, and the pool of users of the data has expanded beyond just regulators and the public to include academics, market researchers, the media, attorneys pursuing private securities class action matters, and market participants themselves who use the data to enhance their ability to compete. As the Release also points out, Form 13F data can assist individuals in making investment decisions, investment managers in managing assets, and corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock. Together, these uses serve a significant purpose in the economy and the efficient functioning of the markets. WhaleWisdom interacts with all of these types of users and in speaking with them regarding the proposal, we have not heard for calls for reform of the current reporting threshold. Most significantly, investors have told us that they are concerned that they will lose access to certain 13F data that is not otherwise available for assistance in trading decisions and performing due diligence. Equally important, users that are potential and current clients of an investment manager have expressed concerns that they will not have access to the data WhaleWisdom produces to verify methodology claims or to see if a particular fund is taking on more risk than claimed, e.g., to identify drifts in investment style. We have heard the same concerns from our other clients: academics (using data for market research and modeling in papers and other studies); media (for reporting on the movements of particular holders of an investment or to analyze the performance of stock picks); law firms (for use in class action litigation in order to identify eligible claimants); and issuers (to identify who their shareholders are, particularly smaller cap issuers). II. The Proposal Would Run Counter to the Primary Goals of Section 13(f) WhaleWisdom will focus its comments on the aspect of the proposal that would amend Rule 13f-1 and Form 13F to raise the threshold for reporting specified equity securities on Form 13F from $100 million to $3.5 billion. As the Commission notes in the proposing release, the Section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals: (1) to create a central repository of data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers; (2) to improve the data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and therefore facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of such managers on the securities markets; and (3) to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. We believe raising the reporting threshold as contemplated by the proposal runs counter to all of these goals. A. The Proposal Would Eliminate Important Transparency into the Markets The SEC has regularly emphasized the importance of transparency of market information across a wide variety of initiatives and has rightfully continued to advocate for the availability of information to investors. The proposal, however, would be detrimental to such transparency and ensuring the Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 3 of 10 creation of a central repository of data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. WhaleWisdom shares the concern raised by SEC Commissioner Lee that the proposal “would eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets.”2 While the release notes that the proposal would retain disclosure of over 90 percent of the dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data, we are concerned that the data that would no longer be reported by the thousands of managers with less than $3.5 billion in Section 13(f) securities would have a detrimental impact on the overall transparency of the securities markets and, as discussed further below, would have a particular negative impact on smaller companies. No Viable Alternative Source Exists for the 13F Data to be Eliminated Despite claims by the Commission in the release to the contrary, WhaleWisdom believes the loss of nearly 90 percent of institutional investment managers currently filing Form 13F reports cannot be replaced by alternate means. Significantly, N-PORT, 13D and 13G filing types do not apply to most of the managers that would not have to report under the proposal. Based on our calculations, using Q2 2020 data, only 14% of managers that fall below the proposed threshold have filed a 13D or 13G since 2018 and only four have filed an N-PORT. In addition, 13D and 13G filings do not provide nearly as much insight as 13F filings and N-PORT filings are even less timely than 13F filings. We therefore strongly recommend that the Commission provide further information as to the uses by investors of these alternatives and that the Commission clarify how “many” of these alternatives provide overlapping or similar data to that included on Form 13F. Adding to the impact of the elimination of a significant amount of filings, smaller managers required to file Form 13F can account for a substantial portion of a stock, particularly a small cap stock’s share base. The tables below, based on WhaleWisdom calculations, illustrate that once you start looking at smaller issuers, particularly below $1 billion in market cap, the ownership percentage of sub-$3.5 billion managers goes up significantly. The following table illustrates a breakdown of 13F shares in Q2 2020 by issuer market capitalization: Market Cap Range Mgr Over $3.5 billion threshold Mgr Under $3.5 billion threshold Over $100B 94% 6% $50B to $100B 92% 8% $20B to $50B 91.6% 8.4% $10B to $20B 89.8% 10.2% $2B to $10B 87% 13% 2 SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, July 10, 2020. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 4 of 10 $1B to $2B 81.9% 18.1% $500M to $1B 75.9 24.1 $250M to $500M 69% 31% Below $250M 60% 40% If you restrict this to “active managers”3 for Q2 2020, the majority of a small-cap stock’s share base belongs to sub-$3.5 billion managers: Market Cap Range Mgr Over $3.5 billion threshold Mgr Under $3.5 billion threshold Over $100B 93% 7% $50B to $100B 90% 10% $20B to $50B 88% 12% $10B to $20B 80.4% 19.6 $2B to $10B 78.5% 21.5% $1B to $2B 72.5% 27.5% $500M to $1B 60% 40% $250M to $500M 53.5% 46.5% Below $250M 46.4% 53.6% B. The Proposal Would Damage the Ability to Consider the Influence and Impact of Institutional Investment Managers The significant reduction of the number of institutional investment managers filing Form 13F will create several difficulties for the ability of market participants to consider the impact of such managers on the markets. While establishing the new reporting threshold to $3.5 billion may still capture 90 percent of the total dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data, approximately 85 percent of “active managers” fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.4 A significant amount of information regarding smaller institutional 3 For example, hedge funds or advisors to a private fund that charge performance based fees with 50% or greater high net worth clients. 4 Based on Q2 2020 data, this accounts for 1,292 out of 1,519 13F filers that are hedge funds, or an advisor to a private fund that charge performance based fees with 50% or greater high net worth clients. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 5 of 10 investment managers that have an outsized impact on the securities markets, such as many hedge funds, would therefore be lost. Impact on Small Issuers Issuers, particularly small cap issuers, would be most negatively impacted by the loss of this data. Stocks are often held in “street name,” i.e., only the broker knows the stockholders true identity. Issuer clients of WhaleWisdom currently use 13F filings to help find out who their real shareholder base is - this cannot be replicated by alternative means and issuers are now fearful they will be more vulnerable to “ambush” tactics by activists who will now be able to accumulate positions in an issuer just under the 13D five percent threshold without disclosure. We also believe that the proposed increase to the Form 13F reporting threshold will make it significantly more difficult for issuers of all types to identify and communicate with their shareholders (e.g., for proxy and quorum purposes). From an investment angle, research into smaller issuers also will be negatively impacted by this change. Larger managers typically invest in larger more liquid issuers as smaller cap stocks often do not provide the necessary liquidity for them to move in and out of positions easily. However, smaller cap stocks often are more suitable for smaller managers who don’t have the same liquidity requirements. When a respected investor discloses a position in a security, more managers become aware of the stock and do their own research into that stock, leading to further investment. This is especially true of smaller issuers with little to no analyst coverage. Exposure to up-and-coming small cap issuers will especially suffer under the proposal, as well as capital formation overall. Leveling the Playing Field for Small Investors Having access to a wide spectrum of active managers’ 13F data, despite the limitations of 45-day filing delays and despite only seeing an incomplete picture of a fund’s portfolio, provides valuable insight and guidance when making investing decisions. WhaleWisdom believes that access to this data makes all investors better investors. Numerous studies have confirmed the benefits of the use of this type of information.5 This is particularly important for smaller investors who can glean knowledge from the investing knowhow and acumen of top investment managers who are otherwise out of reach. Many of these managers would be exempt from filing 13F filings under the proposal. Big data is rapidly changing the way investors find opportunities in the markets. However, rather than creating a level playing field where more readily available information leads to greater market efficiency, the opposite is happening as only those sophisticated investors with the scale and resources to take advantage of the opportunities available will profit.6 Small investors are being left out of this shift; public disclosure of equity positions by these sophisticated investors can allow the 5 See, e.g., “Best Ideas” Anton, Cohen, Polk, Working Paper 21-004, 2020, available at https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/21-004_f616ddeb-db44-495b-915a-0b5191d9ccf3.pdf.

Role in Performing Due Diligence WhaleWisdom receives numerous requests daily for a particular company’s latest 13F filing as investors use Form 13F holdings reports to ensure that a company fits within its risk appetite. Checking Form 13F ownership data is now a standard part of due diligence right alongside other traditional fundamental research. When researching a security, one of the first tools investors use is 13F disclosure data to see who else owns the stock and who has been selling. Investors can assess liquidity, “over crowdedness,” and risk using Form 13F data. Disclosure also serves another important purpose - to encourage managers to run their fund well by shining light on their investment holdings and by giving investors the information they need to make informed decisions about the fund.8 Disclosure also can assist in keeping a manager from drifting away from the fund’s stated investment objective and prevent a manager from taking on more risk than investors were willing to take on. Reducing the number of filers under the proposal will drastically reduce the usefulness and quality of this data and, as discussed above, there is no reasonable alternative source for this information. C. The Proposal Can Reduce Investor Confidence in the Integrity of the U.S. Markets When Congress enacted Section 13(f), Congress noted that “[w]ith the dissemination of data about institutional managers, an institutional disclosure program should stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of our securities markets.”9 WhaleWisdom believes that 13F filings add transparency to the market which helps give investors confidence to invest in our markets. Removing 90 percent of all Form 13F filers from public view will, on the other hand, give the perception that U.S. market disclosure is inadequate. 7 A study by Morningstar found that “Far from creating a level playing field, where more readily available information simply leads to greater market efficiency, the impact of the information revolution is the opposite: it is creating hard-to access “realms” for long-term alpha generation for those players with the scale and resources to take advantage of it.” https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/165439/is-big-data-the-key-to-bigger-investment-returns.aspx 8 See “Does Portfolio Disclosure Make Money Smarter?.” Kang, Sinclair, Xeno, November 20, 2019 (http://www.apjfs.org/resource/global/cafm/2019-7-1.pdf) which found that disclosure of hedge fund portfolio holdings through Form 13F filings helped investors make better decisions when evaluating fund managers: “Our results provide evidence that investors make smarter allocation decisions to funds that publicly disclose their holdings . . . investors are better able to choose the good funds, and avoid the bad funds . . . If regulation can help these institutional investors choose better hedge fund managers, then this is potentially a large gain to the wealth portfolio of a wide cross-section of society.” 9 Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 85 (1975). Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 7 of 10 Similarly, transparency can be an effective tool in ensuring market integrity and combating bad behavior. We believe that Form 13F filings can act as a valuable deterrent to such behavior and robust and accurate Form 13F disclosure can alert regulators and investors to any unlawful behavior. By increasing the threshold for filings to $3.5 billion, all but the approximately 550 largest investment managers would be able to accumulate significant stakes in public companies without a public reporting obligation. As such, many of the most prolific investors whose trading activities have significant impacts on individual public companies as well as the market as a whole would be free from quarterly disclosure obligations. The only remaining entities still consistently reporting on Form 13F would predominantly be large index funds and other passive investors not ordinarily involved in price discovery. As a result, investors would be left with an incomplete view of the asset management market by implementation of the proposal. III. Concerns Regarding Accuracy and Overstatement of Costs of the Proposal The Release discusses a number of costs - both direct and indirect – to filers of Form 13F. While we are not in a position to opine on the economic analysis performed by the Commission, we are concerned, as with other commenters, regarding the Commission’s assessment of the cost savings associated with the proposal. We particularly share SEC Commissioner Lee’s concern that “the approach to revising the burden estimate for Form 13F relies on assumptions that vastly overstate the complexity and resulting burden of the reporting requirement.”10 As a consolidator of Form 13F information, we have seen that changes in technology have given managers the ability to file Form 13F reports much easier and with significantly less advance preparation time, thereby reducing the direct costs involved with filings. Clients have told WhaleWisdom that the cost estimates in the proposal are simply not accurate. The proposal also describes indirect costs associated with Form 13F, including the use of Form 13F data by market participants to engage in front running or copycatting of the investment portfolios of smaller managers, which the Commission states may increase the costs of investing for smaller managers and hinder their investment performance, with potential effects on their portfolios’ owners.11 WhaleWisdom believes that evidence that front running or copycatting due to Form 13F filings actually damages the owners of a portfolio or a portfolio manager’s return is inconclusive at best. Some managers will naturally want to protect their proprietary trading strategies and will argue that Form 13F filings reveal their secrets. We would argue that the built-in limitations of Form 13F filings prevents this, or at the very least reduces this significantly. A manager’s portfolio can contain a large number of positions that would not be disclosed on Form 13F, such as short positions, bonds, and foreign holdings. Also, because Form 13F is reported at the company level and not the fund level, this further obfuscates any proprietary trading strategies. Finally, the built-in delay in 10 SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting, July 10, 2020. 11 In addition, the proposal discusses (a) the costs to smaller managers of requesting confidential treatment of Form 13F information and (b) costs to the Commission associated with staff time and resources spent addressing smaller managers’ inquiries and requests for assistance regarding compliance with Form 13F reporting obligations. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 8 of 10 Form 13F filings prevents investors from knowing exactly when a manager trades into or out of a position. Market participants therefore cannot simply replicate a particular manager’s portfolio. It is important to remember that a manager can always submit an application for confidential treatment as long as they are able to demonstrate to the Commission that disclosure of securities positions would in fact reveal the manager’s investment strategy.12 IV. Alternative to Proposed Reporting Threshold Adjustment WhaleWisdom does not support any change to the Form 13F reporting threshold for the reasons discussed above. However, we recognize the length of time since the reporting threshold has been updated. With that said, if the Commission determines that it is necessary to increase the reporting threshold, WhaleWisdom believes an examination of an increase of a small amount that would still allow for the Commission to capture the holdings of influential managers while easing any perceived burden on smaller investment managers should be the most that the Commission should consider. We recognize that there have been a number of such proposals made by other commenters, such as raising the threshold based on one of the two potential consumer price inflation calculations. Before any such potential increase is adopted, we still recommend that the Commission better illustrate the burdens and costs on smaller managers claimed in the proposal. We also believe that an idea worth examining would be to provide an exclusion to certain types of smaller managers in order to retain the transparency of information of influential managers that would help contribute to an overall better understanding of the U.S. securities market while still addressing the concerns illustrated by the Commission. V. Elimination of Omission Threshold The proposal would eliminate the omission threshold that currently permits managers to exclude from Form 13F certain small positions.13 WhaleWisdom supports the elimination of the omission threshold. We believe this information will add to the transparency around a manager’s holdings and, in turn, to the benefits brought to the markets as discussed above. We also do not believe that the incremental increase in cost, for either large or small managers, is significant to prevent including securities holdings information below the omission threshold on Form 13F.14 12 Similarly, while we are not in a position to opine on the legalities of Commission authority to pursue the changes in the proposal, significantly the raising of the reporting threshold, we are concerned about the uncertainty raised by other commenters regarding the Commission’s authority to pursue the proposed changes. As SEC Commissioner Lee stated, the enabling statute, at Section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold. We are concerned if the Commission would be overstepping its bounds, whether its explicit authority or its exemptive authority, to increase the reporting threshold. 13 Form 13F allows, but does not require, a manager to omit holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal amount of convertible debt securities) and less than $200,000 aggregate fair market value. 14 As the Release notes, if a larger manager were to determine that disclosure of a small holding may negatively affect its competitive position, we believe that a larger manager would be able to seek appropriate protection without undue burden by filing a Form 13F CTR. Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 29, 2020 Page 9 of 10 VI. Other Proposed Amendments The proposal would make other amendments to, most significantly, require filers to provide additional identifying information and require managers to report certain numerical identifiers to enhance the usability of the information provided on Form 13F. Additional Identifying Information The proposed amendments would require each Form 13F filer to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F. WhaleWisdom supports the proposal. We believe that this information would allow the Commission and other consumers of Form 13F data to identify a Form 13F filer’s other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over 13(f) securities more easily. We also believe that disclosing this information would not be unduly burdensome for 13F filers. We also support permitting managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security. WhaleWisdom believes there is a clear need for a unique identifier for every security other than ticker and name, which can have many variations. We would recommend allowing only one security identifier and using a free identifier such as LEI, which is already used in N-PORT filings, or open FIGI. Other Technical Amendments WhaleWisdom also supports requiring filers to round all dollar values listed on Form 13F to the nearest dollar and remove the requirement to omit “000.” We believe there is no need to round and the rounding requirement has caused inconsistencies in filings and that many filers already round to the nearest dollar. The Commission also requests comment on whether there are any other amendments that should be made to streamline Form 13F or simplify its instructions. Filers often report the wrong type of amended filing and will report “new holdings” when the filing should be a complete restatement and vice versa, and some amended filings are a “partial” restatement of holdings. We therefore recommend only allowing a complete restatement of holdings when amending to reduce confusion. * * * * * WhaleWisdom offers its assistance to the Commission as it examines the proposal.

(NYSE: MTX) respectfully opposes the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers increasing the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion AUM. New York -based Minerals Technologies Inc. is a global resource - and technology -based company that develops, produces, and markets a broad range of specialty mineral, mineral -based and synthetic mineral products and related systems and services. We serve the pa per, foundry, steel, construction, environmental, energy, polymer, and consumer products industries. We reported sales of $1.8 billion in 2019 and employed approximately 3,600 people. As a public company, we take seriously the need for effective communica tion with our shareholders, to understand their views and to convey information about our company. To do so, it is important to be able to identify our institutional investors. It is also important that we have visibility regarding the makeup of our stockh older base and changes over time. The proposed amendments would result in a significant loss of market transparency of MTX holders. We depend on 13F filings as the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. As a small / mid -cap issuer, inv estment firms below the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion AUM represent a significant portion of MTX ownership in terms of shares outstanding and number of firms. As of June 30, 2020, 6% of MTX shares outstanding were filed by investors that fall below th e proposed threshold. On a firm basis, 70 out of 249, or 28%, of all MTX filers fall below the proposed threshold. The 249 current MTX filers account for 96% of shares outstanding. Under the proposed threshold, our visibility to MTX ownership would reduce to 90% of shares outstanding. Accordingly, we believe increasing the filing threshold to $3.5 billion AUM would adversely affect our ability to effectively engage with our investors. For example, we conduct an annual shareholder outreach program regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters directed at our top 60 largest holders, as identified by 13F filings. We expect this outreach program will be less effective if we are unable to identify a portion of our largest holders as a result of th e increase in the filing threshold. In fact, 10% of our top 60 largest holders would fall below the proposed threshold. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue. We hope that you will consider our position.

AdvaMed's member companies produce the innovations that are transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less invasive procedures and more effective treatments. AdvaMed has more than 400 member companies, ranging from the largest to the smallest medical technology innovators and manufacturers. AdvaMed advocates for a legal, regulatory and economic environment that advances global health care by assuring worldwide patient access to the benefits of medical technology. The association promotes policies that foster the highest ethical standards, rapid product approvals, appropriate reimbursement, and access to international markets. For the reasons identified below, we oppose the Commission’s proposed amendments to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold by 35 times, from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe the proposal would dramatically reduce information available to the public abou t the identity of the institutional investors in a public company. This significant limitation on transparency is at odds with the Commission’s regulatory agenda in general and with how the Commission itself has explained access to information and its role in facilitating such access. As many respondents have noted already, this lack of transparency will be detrimental to Main Street investors and to the life science industry, in particular, as it relies heavily on these data to plan financing and investor targeting strategies. Specifically , if enacted, the proposal would impair engagement with shareholders, prevent companies from obtaining timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in their stock , and impede the ability of companies to attract new long -term investors . Impair Engagement with Shareholders Companies use 13F data to allocate the limited time of senior executives among the many requests that are receive d from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. Clearly, companies cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with senior management; therefore, the 13F data is used to give priority to not only the largest investors and fund managers with a Bringing innovation to patient care worldwide | 2 track record of activism, but also to those shareholders with sm aller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in a company. By increasing the 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, the proposed amendments would exempt 89% of current 13F filers from the disclosure requirement – drastically limiting AdvaMed's member companies ’ visibility into their shareholder base. Besides Form 13F, shareholders are not required to identify themselves unless they cross the 5% beneficial owner reporting threshold applicable under Sections 13(d) an d 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Public companies generally only have a few shareholders that are Section 13 filers. Accordingly, w ith this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, companies would have poor visibility into their shareholder base , which would seriously undercut their vital shareholder outreach especially to important shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in a company . Increased Risk of Activism The proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures conflicts with recent requests by the SEC that companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic. Along those lin es, the need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. In fact, it is not just the need for ownership data, but it is also the need to receive this data in a timely fashion that is arguably just as important; the requirement to file 45 days after quarter - end renders the information stale when filed and is an antiquated provisio n in the rule, considering how quickly markets move and transactions are completed today. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, companies would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, which w ould include many well -known activists, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule would expose companies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriente d fund managers, who may demand the elimination of jobs, reduction of research funding, increased share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of a long -term strategy that is in the best interest of employees and Main Street investors. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede a company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Many companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar com panies) and to measure the effectiveness of outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying shares each quarter would hinder the ability of a company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. Bringing innovation to patient care worldwide | 2 Conclusion AdvaMed contends that the Commission should not raise the reporting threshold for 13F filings as th is would erode existing corporate decision -making process in place for decades that are instrumental to planning and investor engagement. Raising the threshold to $3.5 billion would eradicate the 13F reporting requirement for 70% of healthcare specialist investors who, given their focus in understanding healthcare sector peculiarities, are critical partners in the decades -long product planning process undertaken by public medical device companies. In addition, the requirement to file 13F filings 45 days af ter quarter -end renders the information stale when filed and is an antiquated provision in the rule. We are in support of shortening this filing period considering how quickly markets move and transactions are completed today. Ultimately, the proposal would severely limit access to information for public issuers and investors, which is the exact opposite direction of where the Commission should be headed.

While we welcome the Commission's interest in modernizing 13F reporting, Newmont is concerned that the proposed amendments will result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly traded companies, which would impair the ability of companies to identify and engage with long-term investors and monitor the activity of potential activists. We believe the proposal would also be a step backwards at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. The transparency provided by the existing Form 13F reporting requirements provides an important source of information about institutional investors, activist hedge funds and others that take positions in our stock. Form 13F filings are the single source of accurate information regarding which certain investor are buying and selling our common stock each quarter. The proposed amendments could impact our ability to accurately identify all but our largest holders. Over 920 institutional investment managers reported holding our common stock earlier this year on Form 13F. However, we believe that number could fall to below 300 if the proposed amendments are adopted. Transparency regarding a public company’s shareholder base is critically important. At Newmont, we believe that engaging with our shareholders is a vital element of good governance and active, ongoing dialogue promotes transparency and accountability. Investor feedback is highly valued by Newmont’s senior management team and shared with the Board, as it is an important foundation for policy development and informs our strategy. Ms. Vanessa Countryman U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 29, 2020 Page 2 Like many other public companies, our investor relations team uses the Form 13F information to target and proactively reach out to investors as part of our annual investor outreach and engagement program, as well as to prioritize and allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors. The proposed increase in the 13F threshold could significantly undermine the ability of companies to identify, prioritize and engage with important groups of investors. Additionally, the proposed amendment increases the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors and activists who fall under the proposed reporting threshold until after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5% or greater position. This would enable activist investors to “go dark” and accumulate shares on a stealth basis, reducing the ability of public companies to monitor those activist investors who may use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of long-term shareholders. We request that the Commission withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and consider the common-sense reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the Commission to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions and shortening the 45-day reporting period. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, /s/ Nancy Buese Nancy Buese Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"

(“ServiceMaster” or the “Company”) is submitting this letter in opposition to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“ Commission ”) proposed amendments to the reporting thresholds for ins titutional managers (the “Proposed Amendments”) discussed in the Commission’s Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 (the “13F Release”) . ServiceMaster is a leading provider of termite and pest control, cleaning and restoration services in both the resid ential and commercial markets, operating through an extensive service network of more than 8,000 Company -owned locations and franchise and license agreements. The Company’s portfolio of well -recognized brands includes AmeriSpec (home inspections), Copesan (commercial national accounts pest management), Furniture Medic (cabinet and furniture repair), Merry Maids (residential cleaning), Nomor (European pest management), ServiceMaster Clean (commercial cleaning), ServiceMaster Restore (restoration and reconstr uction), Terminix (termite and pest control) and Terminix Commercial (commercial termite and pest control). Our stock trades under the symbol “SERV” on the New York Stock Exchange. Executive Summary We believe the Commission should withdraw the Proposed Amendments and strongly oppose the unprecedented 35-fold increase in the threshold requiring institutional investment managers to disclose their equity holding s on Form 13F. We think the Proposed Amendments ignore disclosure trends that value more transparency, not less, and do not believe the Commission ’s discussion in the 13F Release appropriately takes into consideration the negative impact of the Proposed Amendments on corporate issuers and investors. Additionally, we disagree with the Commission’s use of the increase in the aggregate size of the equity markets as the metric by which it calculated the increase to the threshold. Using inflation is a much more reasonable approach and would at most increase the threshold to $453 million. Finally, we do not think the Commission has the statutory authority to increase SERVICEMASTER GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. 150 Peabody Place Memphis, Tennessee 38103 September 29, 2020 Page 2 the threshold for requiring Form 13F reports and may only decrease the threshold in its discretion. The Proposed Amendments Would Have a Negat ive Impact on Shareholder Engagement and Transparency Meaningful shareholder engagement is fundamental to the long -term success of any public company and the Commission has highlighted the importance of shareholder engagement in various proposed rules and public statements. Nonetheless, the Proposed Amendments would materially d ecrease ServiceMaster’s ability to engage our sharehold ers. We rely on the disclosures made on Form 13F to identify and communicate with our investors and under the Proposed Amend ments , at a $3.5 billion threshold for disclosing equity holdings on Form 13F, ServiceMaster would lose visibility into the identity of approximately 33% of these investors. Without access to the vital information provided by Form 13F reports, we would have to rely on Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G reports , which would only provide visibility into investors that own 5% of our outstanding shares. Of the 133 of our investors that would no longer be required to file Forms 13F under the Propo sed Amendments, only five file Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G reports. Assuming similar impacts would be experienced by other corporate issuers, particularly smaller issuers, the Proposed Amendments would have the effect of hindering shareholder engagement across the market. Relatedly, Form 13F reports are a vital tool for identifying and managing activist investors. Activist investors are not restricted to a certain size, and smaller investors are increasingly taking a more vocal approach to their investm ents. In the 13F Release , the Commission incorrectly correlates the size of an investor with its relative significance.1 Without providing any discussion of activist investors in the release, it appears the Commission did not analyze or consider how many active, activist investors would no longer be required to file Form 13F reports under the Proposed Amendments. We believe this must be considered when determining the appropriate threshold for Form 13F reporting requirements. The Increase in the Market Va lue of Publicly Traded Equities Is Not the Right Metric The Commission chose to rely on the growth of the U.S. equities market from 1975 to 2018 as the metric by which to set its increased threshold for Form 13F reporting requirements. In its discussion in the 13F Release , the Commission appears to choose the overall market growth metric based on the outcome it provides , not the reasonableness of using the me tric. The analysis in the 13F Release focuses on the number of investors impacted by each metric the 1 See Reporting Threshold for Institutional Asset Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 34-89290 at 10 (July 10, 2020) ( “Since 1975, the relative significance of managing $100 million in securities as compared with the overall size of the U.S. equities market has declined considerably .”). September 29, 2020 Page 3 Commission considered in order to capture its interpretation of “the group of managers intended to be subject to reporting under section 13(f).”2 This approach appears to be a desired outcome in search of a justification, rather than an unbiased analysis of the most appropriate metric by which to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold. Unless the explicit purpose of the Proposed Amendments is to exempt as many investors as possible , the fact that the growth in market size metric would exempt the most investors from Form 13F reporting is not a reason to use it . Although we believe the Proposed Amendments should be withdrawn entirely . We would support using an inflation -based metric to increase the threshold, not the overall growth in the size of the equities market. Conclusion ServiceMaster prides itself on healthy and robust shareholder engagement. We support initiatives that seek to increase our ability to reach out to our shareholders and engage in meaningful dialogue. The Proposed Amendments do not support shareholder engagement or transparency and will damage investor relations for c orporate issuers and the market. Rather than focus on the Form 13F reporting thresholds, we believe the Commission should focus on disclosure trends that promote more transparency and promote meaningful shareholder engagement and dialogue.

Under the SEC's proposal, the minimum threshold for 13F disclosure would increase by 35 times from $100 million in U.S. equities under management to $3.5 billion. As a result, thousands of fund managers ( estimated to be 89 percent of all current filers) would no longer have to provide disclosure. The significant loss of ownership transparency will impair engagement with shareholders, impede the ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive public companies of timely information about act ivist hedge funds. The 13F filings are the only comprehensive source of quarterly ownership information available to U.S. issuers. While 13F information is not as timely as it could be, it is still the only data we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms which rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Chemours uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of senior executives among the many requests we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings . These discussions include not only business strategy and financial performance, but also environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters related to our Corporate Responsibility Commitment . We cannot possibly accommodate every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to prioritize larger investors and fund managers wit h a track record of activism , as well as The Chemours Company 1007 Market Street Wilmington, DE 19801 shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into th ese important group s. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data would also impede our ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. The lack of information regarding who holds or is acquiring our shares each quarter would impair our ability to effectively access the capital markets. Increased Risk of Activism The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes companies to a greater risk of short - term activis t investors , who may demand measures that are not part of a long-term investment strategy. With 2019 being a record year for activism , and corporate advisers warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism after the pandemic subsides, the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be particularly detrimental . For the reasons above, we respectfully request that the Commissi on withdraw its proposed 13F amendments . Chemours support s the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by NYSE and NIRI (as well as Nasdaq and the Society for Corporate Governance ). Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete ownership disclosure. Sincerely, Jonathan Lock Vice President , Corporate Development and Investor Relations"

Countryman: TransUnion1 appreciate s the opportunity to respond to the S ecurities and Exchange Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. While we welcome the Commission’s interest in modernizing 13F reporting, we believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around hedge fund activism, significantly undermine issuer -investor engagement, and deprive retail investors of information they use to make investment decisions. We urge the Commission to withdraw the proposal and instead focus on bringing greater trans parency to the market by increasing the frequency and quality of disclosures. For mid-cap companies , like TransUnion, the potential ramifications of the propose d amendments merit particular attention . As a publicly traded company, TransUnion relies heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around investor holdings and significantly undermin e our issuer -investor engagement efforts by excluding nearly 90% of investment managers from disclosure. The potential reductions in necessary transparency are clear when we consider our own investor engagement data and experience. Based on reporting as of June 30, 2 020, there were approximately 650 institutional holders holding 190 million outstanding shares of TransUnion or approximately 99 percent of total shares outstanding. If the proposal were enacted, we would lose visibility on approximately 250 of our shareho lders that are also 13F filers or approximately 40 percent, a significant loss of market transparency.

Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Teachers,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7860397-223962.pdf,,"September 29, 2020 Via: rule-comments@sec.gov Vanessa Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F St, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (File No. S7-08-20) The Communications Workers of America (“CWA”) and the American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”) object to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposal to raise the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers. CWA represents approximately 700,000 working people in telecommunications, customer service, media, airlines, health care, public service and education, and manufacturing. CWA members are both employees and investors. As employees, our members face coordinated attacks on their employers by activist hedge funds that eliminate good jobs through workforce reductions and outsourcing. As participants in pension funds, 401-Ks and individual retirement accounts, our members are invested in the broad stock market and are harmed when “hedge fund activism” undercuts long-term strategic investment by indexed companies. The AFT is a union of 1.7 million members, including pre-K through 12th-grade teachers; paraprofessionals and other school-related personnel; higher education faculty and professional staff; federal, state and local government employees; and nurses and other healthcare professionals. AFT members participate in public-sector defined benefit pension plans totaling an estimated $3 trillion and in private, defined contribution retirement plans, both of which are broadly exposed to the stock market. The proposed rule could negatively impact our members by creating an imbalance between corporate knowledge of their investors and the public’s knowledge, making many of the publicly-traded companies they invest with more vulnerable to pressure from “activist” hedge funds. As advocates for workers and investors, we generally favor the flow of information to the public and market participants, and object to efforts to block information about institutional investors’ holdings. The SEC’s proposal to increase the threshold for reports filed by institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion (“Form 13F”) is contrary to the law and the Commission’s mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.1 We urge you to withdraw the proposal. 1 See comment by Tyler Gellasch, Healthy Markets: “The 13F Proposal ignores the law, the legislative history, and the clear purpose for the law itself… The statute itself does not contemplate the Commission raising the reporting threshold beyond $100 million. However, the statute expressly contemplates lowering the reporting threshold, but then limits the Commission’s authority to set the threshold below $10 million. Put simply, the statute establishes a range within which the threshold is to be set: $10-$100 million.” Healthy Markets Comment on Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, August 28, 2020. As described in greater detail below, the actions of Elliot Management in its engagement with AT&T clearly demonstrate both the need for improving 13F requirements, and how the proposal would go in the opposite direction. I. 13F Disclosures Are Already Inadequate and Raising The Threshold From $100 Million To $3.5 Billion Would Further Deny Investors and the Public With Information About The True Size And Structure Of Publicly Promoted Investment Theses. The SEC’s press release announcing the proposed amendments to update Form 13F states it “was adopted pursuant to a 1975 statutory directive designed to provide the Commission with data from larger managers about their investment activities and holdings, so that their influence and impact could be considered in maintaining fair and orderly securities markets.”2 The SEC’s proposal to update the reporting threshold does not serve the statutory directive that motivated disclosure in the first place. Large managers have multiple ways of exerting control and influencing companies that are not captured under by Form 13F requirements. As discussed below, raising the threshold would reduce insight into already opaque markets, impeding the ability of the SEC and investment decision makers to consider the influence and impact or large managers. In September 2019, Elliott Management announced an activist intervention in AT&T that claimed one of the largest and most successful companies in the United States could be improved by divesting assets, extracting cash through share repurchases, and reducing and outsourcing its workforce. Elliott publicly touted that it managed “funds that collectively beneficially own $3.2 billion of AT&T” to demonstrate its commitment to its plan at AT&T. Elliott’s press release announcing its economic interest in AT&T and subsequent coverage of the intervention in the financial press portrayed Elliott’s interest in AT&T as a significant, value-oriented investment. For example, almost one year after Elliott announced the AT&T intervention, an article in Forbes inaccurately stated that “Elliott Management Corporation, which invested $3.2 billion into AT&T…”3 In fact, nowhere in Elliott’s letter to AT&T does it provide details on the structure of its investment in AT&T other than the topline $3.2 billion beneficial ownership stake. A review of 13-F filings shows that at no point has the disclosed value of Elliott’s interest in AT&T reached the topline $3.2 billion beneficial ownership it announced in September 2019. This suggests that Elliott designed its economic interest in AT&T using securities that are not required to be disclosed under rule 13F-1, such as short-interest and synthetic positions. With regard to securities that must be disclosed under rule 13F-1, Elliott’s filings reveal that the structure of its economic interest in AT&T at different times comprised a combination of shares 2 “SEC Proposes Amendments to Update Form 13F for Institutional Investment Managers; Amend Reporting Threshold to Reflect Today’s Equities Markets,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, July 10, 2020. 3 Karen Robinson-Jacobs, “AT&T Reportedly Looking to Shed DirectTV After Persistent Subscriber Losses,” August 28, 2020. and call options or shares alone. The disclosed securities amounted to only about $900 million in underlying value at their height. This disconnect demonstrates that the definition of Section 13(f) securities is facially inadequate and should be reformed. Significant equity interests are clearly not adequately being captured. II. 13F Disclosures Provide Valuable Information That Would Be Lost By Raising the Threshold. While the current 13-F picture is incomplete, it provides important insight. Investors and stakeholders who may have been swayed by Elliott’s pitch on AT&T’s future can arrive at the informed conclusion that Elliott lost faith in its own argument by analyzing its 13F disclosures. Elliott Management Corporation “Investment” In AT&T Rhetoric versus Reality Rhetoric Reality Elliott Management Corporation Elliott claimed $3.2 billion beneficial ownership in AT&T for value-focused investment. Elliott disclosed 3.125 million share investment worth approximately $118 million and equal to 0.04% of AT&T market capitalization. Form 13F for period 2019-09-30 Elliott’s disclosed shares increased to 5 million, plus additional $791 call option position bringing total disclosed interest to less than $1 billion. Form 13F for period 2019-12-31 Elliott disclosed that it essentially halved option position to 10.5 million calls. Form 13F for period 2020-03-31 Elliott disclosed 5 million share investment worth approximately $151 million and no options. Form 13F for period 2020-06-30 The information in these disclosures protects investors by revealing the dollar amount and partial structure of Elliott’s investment. The declining value of its disclosed position may indicate Elliott’s diminished confidence in its ability to unlock value by attacking AT&T. Elliott has not increased long-exposure since the quarter following its intervention, despite early claims that its agenda would result in a 65% share price increase by the end of 2021.4 Investors can use this information to evaluate whether Elliott’s short-term, extractive approach to driving up the stock price is appropriate for a telecom giant that relies on large-scale capital investment for sustainable growth. The proposed change gives an unfair advantage to large investment fund managers like Elliott Management by denying other market participants information necessary to judge the merits of activist investors’ publicly promoted investment theses and arrive at informed conclusions about their expected outcome. III. Raising The 13F Reporting Threshold Would Not Help Facilitate Capital Formation. Reports filed by institutional investment managers are a component of the mosaic of public information that the investing public can use to make decisions that are part of the capital formation process. Increasing the reporting threshold would take this information out of the hands of decision makers who must understand the merits of investment theses and potential impact of actions by other market participants. In 2011, Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar told the Council of Institutional Investors that “Facilitating true capital formation is about helping investors and other capital providers to make informed decisions. Almost all investments have risks, and while we all understand the need for investors to take risks, I want them to take informed risks. Capital formation is about ensuring that the companies with the best ideas, even if those ideas are risky, can get the financing to make those ideas a reality.”5 As Elliott’s intervention in AT&T demonstrates, access to information about the size and structure of institutional positions connected to activist campaigns allows other market participants to judge their merits and calibrate individual investments according to the expected likelihood of success. Evaluating investment ideas is a critical step in capital formation, and Forms 13F provide information that decision makers use to for insight into the actions of other market participants. IV. Seeking To Change The Scope Of Investment Managers Subject To The Rule 13F Requirements Before Determining The Type And Timing Of Information Subject To Disclosure Is Unfair. It is unfair and inappropriate to propose changes to the scope of managers required to file reports on Form 13F before considering other potential amendments to the Form. This approach focuses only on the types of managers subject to 13F disclosure rather than embarking on a broader 4 “Elliott Management Sends Letter to Board Of Directors of AT&T,” Elliott Management, September 9, 2019. 5 Speech by SEC Commissioner: Facilitating Real Capital Formation by Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Council of Institutional Investors Spring Meeting, Washington, D.C., April 4, 2011. evaluation of the important issues of the type and timing of information subject to disclosure. In footnote 28 to the notice of proposed rulemaking, the SEC states “The Commission has also received petitions for rulemakings regarding other aspects of Form 13F.” These proposals quite plainly went in the opposite direction of this proposal, and sought to enhance market efficiency by improving market transparency. They would have shortened the reporting deadline and expanded the types of investment activities subject to disclosure. • In 2011, the NYSE Euronext, the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals, and the National Investor Relations Institute requested that the Commission review shortening the 45-day reporting deadline under rule 13F-1.6 • In 2015, the NYSE Group and the National Investor Relations Institute petitioned the SEC to require public disclosure of short sale activities under section 13F.7 Each of these requests would enhance market efficiency by providing investors with more timely and pertinent information about the actual size and structure of investment activities. By offering this anti-transparency proposal, the SEC is favoring the financial interests of a handful of large, activist investment managers over the majority of other market participants and the public. And yet it has offered no rationale for that choice other than what appear to numbers related to the purported costs of making disclosures that do not have a research basis. According to analysis by the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, “The SEC asserted that the benefits of the proposed change include potential annual savings of approximately $15,000-$30,000 per ‘smaller’ manager, and reduction of indirect costs to “smaller” managers such as front running and copycatting… The SEC also noted that the academic literature supporting its views concerning indirect costs provide, at best, ‘partial’ evidence, and generally did not demonstrate harm to the reporting entities related to the front running and copycatting issues that the SEC suggested might be problematic.”8 At the same time, the SEC has offered no analysis on the costs to investors, issuers, or the public of the loss of the information. IHS Markit’s analysis of the SEC’s proposed change shows that raising the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion would eliminate filing requirements for 86% of activist investors and preclude information about 83% of dollars dedicated to activist investments from disclosure. According to IHS Markit, “Activists tend to build concentrated positions and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3.5B in EAUM. This threshold could apply to a few titans of the industry as many activists have only a small portion of their total portfolio in registered 13F positions.”9 6 NYSE Euronext Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, February 1, 2013. 7 NYSE, NIRI Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, October 7, 2015. 8 Adam Emmerich, David Silk, Sabastian Niles, “Going Dark: SEC Proposes Amendments to Form 13F,” Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, July 19, 2020. 9 Shannon McDermott, “SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,” Ipreo IHS Markit, August 7, 2020. According to an analysis by Bloomberg News,10 some of the largest fund managers in the world would likely be excluded from having to report their holdings. This is diametrically opposed to the intent of the 13F filing requirement in the first place. V. Conclusion The Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Teachers object to any change to the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers that reduces the ability of our organizations to evaluate activist hedge fund attacks on the companies that employ our members, and any change that reduces market transparency for our investor-members. Rather than pursue this misguided rule making, the SEC should return to previous proposals and determine what types of information protects investors, facilitates capital formation, and enhances fairness.

Galva on S7-08-20 September 29, 2020 I am strongly opposed to this rule change because (1) it would significantly harm a broad set of market participants, (2) any modest benefits to a small set of stakeholders would be more than offset by substantial costs to other stakeholders, and (3) the SEC lacks the authority to enact the proposed rule change: 1. Proposal drastically reduces market transparency for all stakeholders (e.g., investors, companies, market intermediaries, academics, government / regulators) and erodes the benefits they derive from the transparency since there is no viable alternative source for the information contained in 13F filings. I believe the value of this market transparency is enormous which is supported by the unprecedented and broad based opposition to the proposed rule change presented in the comments submitted to the SEC 2. Proposal would not achieve savings because the process to file 13Fs is largely automated and any savings achieved would be offset by substantial costs incurred by other stakeholders in an attempt to partially recreate the information contained in 13Fs (e.g., investor relations professionals paying service providers to identify their shareholders). Additionally, the concerns around front-running or stealing a 13F filer's intellectual property are not valid due to (1) the substantial reporting time lag of between 45 and 135 days after trade activity occurs, (2) the lack of any analysis or evidence to support this concern, and (3) the substantial opposition to this proposed rule change from the investment management community 3. Proposal violates the 13F provision which gives the SEC the right to lower the reporting threshold but not to raise it. If the SEC were to use its exemptive authority that would violate the spirit of the provision the SEC is meant to uphold and would contradict the legislative history surrounding this rule, most notably the 1975 Senate Banking Committee bill requiring the SEC set the reporting threshold at ""at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount"" as noted by Alexander I.

ASA is concerned the Proposal will reduce transparency in the U.S. equity markets, undermine investor confidence, negatively impact the long -term performance of public companies, and harm American workers. Our Constitutional and poli cy concerns are outlined in greater detail below. I. SEC Does Not Have the Constitutional Authority to Change a Statute. We ar e unaware of any regulatory or const itutional authority that would allow t he SEC to amend the $100 million reporting threshold set forth in Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act. No matter how much an administrative agency may disagree with the plain language of a statue, 2 only publicly elected members of Congress can alter the plain language of a statute and send it to the President to be signed into law. 3 Furthermore , the SECs assertion of broad statutory authority to amend a rule that implements a specific reporting threshold set by Congress and lacks a public interest justification looks like a legal gymnastic s tretch that could end in a bad injury. Additionally, there is no indication that Congress has ever intended th at the SEC suddenly 1 The ASA is a trade association that represents the retail and institutional capital markets interests of regional financial services firms who provide Main Street businesses with access to capital and advise hardworking Americans how to create and preserve wealth. The ASA’s mission is to promote trust and confidence among investors, facilitate capital formation, and support efficient and competitively balanced capital markets. This mission advances financial independence, stimulates job creation, and increases prosperity. The ASA has a geographically divers e membership base that spans the Heartland, Southwest, Southeast, Atlantic, and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States. 2 17 CFR § 240.13f -1(a)(1). 3 Article 1 Sec. 8 of the Constitution vested Congress with the power to make all laws. Justice Clarence Thomas clearly noted the courts position on this power saying, “[w]e have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there”, Conn. Nat’l Bank v. Ger main, 503 U.S. 249, 253- 54 (1992). increase the reporting threshold by a factor of thirty -five (35) .4 Consequently, this Proposal is legally flawed and appears to be indefensible on its face. If we disregard the constitutional process and comment on this Proposal as if it could actually pass legal muster in a n Article III court , then we oppose it because it would dramatically reduce transparency in the U.S. equity market s, undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our market s, negatively impact the long- term performance of public companies , and harm American workers as corporate raiders would be incented to dismantle company after company across this country. Section 13(f) disclosures are an important source of information to public company management, investors, and American workers , both union and non- union. Eliminating them, would t ilt the scales in favor of acti vist and takeover “wolf pack ” hedge funds exercising short -term agendas at the expense of workers, long- term investors, and our capital markets. Th e policy of this proposal seems to suggest that this country should fully embrace the Gordon Ge kko “smash -and-grab” model of capitalism personified by today’s Wall Street vulture funds . 5 Because of its unquestionable legal flaws and severe negative impact on companies, shareholders, American workers, and the integrity of our market s, we suggest the Commission reverse course on this Proposal immediately . The Commission should not be seen to be ignoring well -established principles of const itutional law in order to c ater to Wall Street billionaires and corporate raiders over workers and investors , which would seem to be contrary to its core mission. II. General Policy Observation s. Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act requires money managers controlling at least $100 million to disclose their holdings of equity and certain other securities within 45 days after the end of each quarter. These disclosures help public companies understand who owns their shares and they communicate a money manager’s position to the broader market. Form 13F requirements have been in place since 1975, are well understood by market participants , and impose minimal compliance burdens on money managers. These disclosures are the most significant – and in many cases the only – source of information about public companies’ shareholder base. Having insight into ownership is an important way for companies to assess and weigh the different perspectives of their shareholders when it comes to corporate decision -making. This knowledge also helps management allocate its time and attention across different investor relations efforts , especially as it relates to shareholder proposals and the composition of the board. Form 13F disclosures therefore promote – and 4 “Congress anticipated that government agencies, including the SEC, would be expected to make extensive use of the institutional disclosure data in fulfilling their responsibilities to protect the public interest within a consistent and coordinated regulatory framework ” https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf “Review of SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements”. 5 Wall Street. Directed by Oliver Stone, 1987. indeed are critical to – good corporate governance, as they facilitate dial og and alignment between those who own a company and those who control it. The Proposal would inexplicably raise the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion. By the SEC’s own estimates, this would slash the number of 13F filers by 90% , depriving companies of critical information about who their most significant and engaged shareholder s are. 6 In addition, raising the threshold in this manner would allow almost every activist hedge fund to “go dark” and shield their ownership of public companies from the management , the shareholders , and the workers of those companies .7 How the SEC arrive d at this number is an interesting exercise of math ? The absurdity of picking an outrageously inflated number out of thin air and proposing it as the right number cannot be overstated. Given that reality, we believe there is no legal , market , or evidenc e based justification for this P roposal to proceed. III. No J ustification Exists to A mend Form 13F R equirements . The Proposal fails to provide any justification for why an increase in the 13F reporting threshold aside from speculation that minimal cost savings for hedge funds , will somehow be good for the market or investors as a whole. It is unclear how the benefit of a multi- billion hedge fund saving $15,000- $30,000 per year in compliance costs outweighs the lack of transparency and aggressive activism that will undoubtedly increase as a result of the rule. In fact, in recent years the SEC has received numerous requests to do just the opposite of what is outlined in the Proposal. The SEC has received rulemaking petitions and several comment letters calling on the Commission to increase reporting requirements . For example, a 2013 rulemaking petition from the National Investor Relations Institute, New York Stock Exchange, and the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals called on the SEC to shorten the 45-day reporting delay at the end of each quarter. 8 The SEC has also received a rulemaking petition and been called on by Congress to shorten timeframes for other money manager reporting requirements, including those under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. 9 IV.

The Proposal asserts that a threshold increase “would provide meaningful regulatory relief for smaller managers that manage less than $3.5 billion in 13(f) assets.” The ASA simply disagrees 6 Ironically, the entities that would remain subject to Form 13F reporting under the Proposal would be large index funds and asset managers that invest passively , and that therefore have little interest and rarely engag e with the management of the companies they invest in. 7 Proposal at 17. 8 https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf 9 https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2011/petn4 -624.pdf ; Importantly, Memorandum dated September 24, 2010 from Deputy Chief of Staff to the Inspector General set forth in Appendix V to “R eview of SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements” said “[w]e emphasize that consideration of significant changes to Form13F should be part of a coordinated review of the overall SEC system f or disclosing ownership and transactions in the securities of public companies, rather than in isolation .” https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf that a hedge fund managing $3.5 billion in assets ( and in some cases more) could under any circumstances be considered “small.” As evidenced in a recent law firm memo, the Proposal would likely exempt some of the most well- known hedge fund managers on Wall Street from transparency requirements .10 To put this into perspective, the median market capitalization of the Russell 3000 index is roughly $1.6 billion. Small and mid -capitalization companies – who depend on current 13F reports to determine who their shareholders are – would be the most negatively impacted by this rule and many would likely become targets of activist hedge funds and corporate raiders. V. The Proposal Lacks Any Rational E conomic A nalysis . The Commission’s emphasis on reducing compliance costs to justify the rule seems to be borne out of an unsupported concern about protect ing the intellectual property and anonymity of hedge funds . In reality, the mechanics of a 13F filing are straightforward and, in many cases, automated. The SEC should not be prioritizing the reduction of minimal compliance burdens for sophisticated hedge funds at the expense of revealing important information to the public . The other Commission argument the public is supposed to believe is t hat the filing of Form 13F requires managers to disclose alleged ly proprietary investment strategies . Thi s is also fundamentally flawed because as the SEC itself acknowledges in the Proposal , fund managers can apply for confidential treatment if a particular disclosure would harm the fund or its investor s. We therefore believe the current rules already more than placate any supposed concerns the SEC and these hedge fund managers may have over the disclosure of potentially sensitive information. VI. Conclusion Rather than improve transparency in the U.S. securities markets , increas e the integrity of our markets , and protect worker rights, this Proposal asks the public to side with billionaire hedge fund managers who destroy companies and fire workers because the current regulatory regime costs them too much. Given all the concerns outlined above, the ASA strongly opposes this Proposal. We urge the Commission to refrain from enacting policies that will give hedge funds a green light to ruin public companies, destroy the lives of American workers and further exacerbate income inequality. Instead, the SEC should make a better use of use taxpayer money and its own time by acting on the pending rulemaking petitions calling for enhanced disclosures from hedge funds and other money managers. 10 https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/07/19/going-dark -sec-proposes -amendments -to-form -13f/ We stand ready to assist on Constitutional and policy issues related to this Proposal and as a resource in any other way we can.

We represent members who are investor relations officers and in positions with similar responsibility at publicly traded companies headquartered in Southeastern Pennsylvania and its immediate, surrounding areas . These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , have a combined market capitalization of approximately $1.4 trillion . We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million , would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark. This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our member s’ compan ies as well as othe r issuers in the United States. According to an IHS Markit analysis of the Russell 3000, an average company would lose visibility i nto 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list. 1 We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our member s’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings are the only comprehensive ownership information available to our member s’ compan ies as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is no t as timely or complete as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling thei r shares each quarter. This data 1 See IHS Markit, ""SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,"" August 7, 2020, available at: https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ . cannot be replaced by retaining stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small - and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fa ll under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. While o ur member s agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on public companies’ ability to engage with their shareholders on proxy voting matters , attract new long -term investors, and monitor hedge fund activists far outweigh the minimal cost savings for investment managers. We ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance. 2 We believe that retail investors , investment managers, and companies all would b enefit from more timely and complete disclosure through reduc ing the 45-day reporting period and expanding 13F disclosure to include short positions . To achieve these objectives , we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors , issuers, and other stakeholders on potential 13F reforms and other market transparency issues, including propos als to address “short and distort” abuses, the repeal of the OBO /NOBO rules, and the modernization of 13D reporting. 3 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Pa ragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659 (February 4, 2013 ), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking P ursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689 (October 7, 2015) , available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691 (December 7, 2015 ), available at https ://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 3 See Professors John C.

Robert Grusky,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223792.htm,,"Sep. 28, 2020 Dear Sir or Mesdames: I agree with the comments put forth by Market Folly, specifically: “Counterpoints to the SEC's 13F Proposal 1) 13F Filing Costs For Managers Are Negligible The SEC's main rationale for the proposal is that it would provide relief for smaller managers. It argues that smaller managers that would no longer file 13Fs would save direct compliance costs that ""could range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager."" One hedge fund told us that at worst they see around $3,500 in costs per quarter to file a 13F, or around $14,000 per year, just below the low-end of the SEC's estimates. Another hedge fund noted that costs and time associated with filing 13Fs are negligible. Any 'relief' that would fall to smaller managers is de minimis, at best. Examining a hypothetical scenario of firms currently most impacted showcases this: a firm managing $100 million with only a 1% management fee and no performance fee theoretically earns $1 million in revenue a year. Taking the SEC's highest estimate of yearly filing costs ($30,000) and dividing that by the firm's hypothetical yearly revenue ($1 million) means that annual filing costs would be only 3% of revenue. And using the SEC's own estimates, that's the worst case scenario since it's the smallest firm required to file a 13F. A $500 million firm in the same scenario would only spend 0.6% of its revenue on 13F filings a year, while a $1 billion firm would only spend 0.3% of revenue on 13F filings a year, and so on. Given the technological advancements implemented by the SEC such as XBRL and automation, it's easier and cheaper than ever to submit a 13F. Filings are straightforward and not time consuming. 2) It's Hard To Front-Run Someone 6 Weeks Later The proposal argues that there are also ""indirect costs faced by smaller managers, such as those associated with potential front-running."" A frontrunner is defined as: one who trades “in front of an expected trade by another investor, thereby making the same trade on the terms the other investor would otherwise have got.” 13Fs are filed with the SEC 45 days after quarter-end. It's hard to front-run someone if you're receiving the information of their actions six weeks later. This argument does not hold weight and would only apply to unique situations such as illiquid shares. The time-delayed reporting of holdings via 13F filing already nullifies the vast majority of any potential front-running. 3) Negative Consequences for Smaller Managers The SEC must also consider the negative ramifications for smaller managers who would no longer file 13Fs. Many limited partners utilize 13Fs to corroborate portfolio level details of managers they're invested in. This helps prevent another Madoff situation and furthers transparency. It would also reduce small manager discovery. One institutional allocator told us that under the proposal, it would be increasingly difficult for them to consider investing in smaller managers due to the lack of transparency that otherwise aides in monitoring of potential managers to allocate capital to. 4) Drastically Reduces Transparency & Limits Future Academic Research The loss of 90% of 13F filers and $2.3 trillion of investment holdings will drastically reduce market transparency and should be reason enough to reject the proposal. It would also hinder academic research about markets and securities. In a world that's becoming more data-driven by the day, going in the opposite direction is not progress. 5) Capital Formation Exists in Current Setup An argument can be made that the fact that X respected investor invests in Y stock leads to capital formation because other investors are then more inclined to examine and potentially invest in a company they might otherwise not have known about or bothered to look at. This is particularly the case in small caps, where there's less sell-side coverage and less eyeballs on the companies in general. So capital formation can be achieved in the current structure because these managers are disclosing stakes in said companies. And again, due to the 45-day lag for disclosure, they are insulated from front-running. And as far as we're aware, most investors want other people to be interested in and to buy the stocks they've already built stakes in. Increased demand can lead to an increase in share price, thus benefiting the investor that already built a position, not burden them with increased costs as the proposal suggests. Idea sharing will happen regardless of the proposal or not via idea dinners, conferences, passing around quarterly letters, instant/direct messages, email, word of mouth, etc. Humans by nature are mimetic beings. 6) Investors & Companies Won't Know The Shareholder Base; Public Companies Will See Increased Costs & Time Removing 90% of 13F filers drastically reduces the data available to companies as to who their shareholder base is, especially in small and mid cap names. While major holders are revealed via 13D, 13G, and Form 4 filings, the rest of the shareholder base would become opaque. When asked if the proposal would result in increased costs and time for their publicly traded company, one head of investor relations at a small cap replied, ""Definitely."" They also noted they're ""not entirely sure how to prove who is actually a (share)holder"" for companies that don't pay a dividend, while companies that do pay one can glean some potential insight. Another investor relations professional said that the proposal would add costs for their company each year because they'll have to pay a firm to analyze trading activity in their shares to figure out the rest of the shareholder base. And even then, this data wouldn't be accurate or even complete. Investors also often want to know who their fellow shareholders are, particularly when it comes to hedge fund 'crowding.' Also, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) submitted a letter on behalf of 237 publicly traded companies, 26 investor relations consulting firms, and five industry associations. All of them oppose the SEC's proposal. This includes the likes of Sherwin-Williams, Mastercard, Chipotle, FedEx, Procter & Gamble, Marriott, Delta Air Lines, among many others. Lastly, the NYSE along with 381 undersigned public companies also sent a letter opposing the proposal. 7) Commissioner Allison Herren Lee Opposes the Proposal Via a statement published on the SEC's website here, she writes: ""I am concerned that the projected cost savings in today’s proposal are greatly overstated and wholly inconsistent with the Commission’s past analysis—and, importantly, that the actual cost savings do not justify the loss of visibility into portfolios controlling $2.3 trillion in assets. Additionally, the Commission’s assertion of authority to raise the threshold conflicts with the plain text in the Exchange Act that requires us to collect the information. Specifically, section 13(f)(1) withholds authority from the Commission to raise the threshold, and the proposal fails to address that conflict."" 8) Negative Public Response In a poll asking if the SEC's proposal was a good idea or not, 75% of respondents said it was a bad idea and 25% said it was a good idea. A follow-up poll asked what the 13F filing threshold should be if the SEC is deadset on raising the limit: 62% of respondents said $500 million 29% of respondents said $1 billion 5% of respondents said the proposed $3.5 billion 4% of respondents said $5 billion or higher Not to mention, the overwhelming majority of public comments the SEC has received thus far regarding the proposal have vehemently opposed it. Here's a link to all the comments. Additionally, here are a just a few of the headlines/articles reacting negatively to the proposal: - Financial Times: SEC disclosure change would allow activists to 'go dark', lawyers warn - Bloomberg: Goldman warns SEC proposal could shroud hedge fund crowding - Nasdaq: President of Nasdaq says transparency is at risk with proposed changes to form 13F - Harvard Law Forum on Corporate Governance: Adoption of the SEC’s current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company’s institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis - Columbia Law School Blog on Corporations and the Capital Markets: Why the SEC's proposal to amend rule 13f-1 should fail - National Investor Relations Institute: An average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list - IHS Markit: An astounding 86% of (activist investors) would no longer be required to file 13F's - CNBC: Jim Cramer rips SEC's proposed rule change for institutional investors 9) Proposal Goes Against Original 13F Goals & SEC's Own Mission Here are the original goals of the 13F (from page 9): ""The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets."" A higher reporting threshold resulting in a drastic reduction in the amount of data does not 'improve the body of factual data.' It does the exact opposite. Reduced transparency as a result of the proposal would decrease investor confidence, not increase it as the original goal states. And the repository of historical data would be severely impaired going forward. The SEC's own website lists its mission as: ""The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. The SEC strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public's trust."" The proposal severely reduces transparency, which does not protect investors. Such reduced transparency also erodes the environment of public trust that the SEC aims to achieve. If the SEC is deadset on raising the filing threshold for the sake of modernization or to reduce its own burden, utilizing the inflation metric and setting the threshold at ~$500 million would reduce the number of filers by 50% (thus reducing any burdens on both the SEC & the smallest managers) while maintaining more transparency. The poll above also shows this is more palatable than the proposal's $3.5 billion threshold. Simply put though, the negatives associated with the proposal greatly outweigh any perceived positives.“ Market Folly I ask that you amend or drop the proposal to change the AUM threshold for 13F reporting. You could index the current level for inflation, or perhaps take it to $250m. Respectfully, Robert R Grusky Hope Capital Management, LLC 571 Indian Harbor Road Vero Beach, FL 32963 Sent from my iPad"

We represent members who are investor relations officers at publicly held companies headquartered in the Cleveland/Northeast Ohio area. These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, have a combined market capitalization approaching $200 billion. We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million, would allow almost 90 percent of current 13F filers to go dark. This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our members’ companies as well as other public companies in Northeast Ohio and the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede companies’ ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive our members of timely information about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies. We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our members’ companies and their obligation to regularly engage with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings can be the only accurate source of ownership information available to our members’ companies as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, at a sizable fee, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. While the proposal cites as a benefit the reduced burden for smaller asset managers, the reality is that technology advancements in the years since the 13F rule was issued make reporting markedly easier and have lessened the burden to the point it would not be unreasonable for these firms to report weekly, if not daily. To no longer require reporting of activity for funds below $3.5B introduces an opaqueness to the markets that does not serve anyone well. As our markets, and trading itself, become more complex with the evolution of technology and financial instruments, we need more transparency of information, not less. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small- and mid-cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. We also agree with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduce transparency and the public’s access to market information. She also questioned whether the SEC “has the authority to pursue” those changes by pointing out that the “enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold.”1 2 While our members agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on the ability of Investor Relations Officers to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and monitor activists far outweigh any potential cost savings for investment managers. In addition, the proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules. For the above reasons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate 1 As Commissioner Lee pointed out in her dissenting statement: “To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter (emphasis added). The text is clear: Congress set a statutory reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it. Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting,” July 10, 2020, available at: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10. 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for institutional investment managers to provide more disclosure, rather than less transparency. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 directed the Commission to require 13F filers to report short positions each month, while Section 951 of Dodd-Frank instructed the SEC to require 13F filers to annually disclose their votes on executive compensation matters. Governance.3 Rather than reduce transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by working with Congress to support monthly reporting, require the public disclosure of short positions, and reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period. To achieve these objectives, we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors, issuers, and the exchanges on a wide range of market transparency issues, including potential 13F reforms, proposed rules to address “short and distort” abuses, and the modernization of 13D reporting.4 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington , DC 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: I am writing on behalf of Valvoline Inc. (NYSE: VVV), a Kentucky corporation (“ Valvoline ” or the “Company ”) to express our opposition to the Security and Exchange Commission’s (the “ Commission ”) proposed amendments to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion. As the Commission increasingly demands greater transparency from public issuers, we believe that the Commission should also expect a similar degree of transparency from institutional investment managers with re spect to ownership of section 13(f) securities to ensure active and open dialogue continues between issuers and their shareholders. The Commission’s proposed amendments would severely limit market transparency and reduce a company’s visibility into its sha reholder base, as it is estimated that nearly 90 percent of current 13F filers would no longer be required to file such reports. We believe the loss of such visibility would have the following negative consequences to the Company (and to other public issue rs): • Impairs engagement with shareholders . Form 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information regarding “street name” investors available to public issuers. We routinely use Form 13F data to prioritize the time of our senior executives with current and/or prospective shareholders for one -on-one calls or meetings, roadshows and investor conferences. The loss of a significant portion of that data would hinder the Company’s ability to prioritize senior management’s limited time with invest ors and potential investors, reducing engagement with shareholders. • Diminishes our ability to proactively reach -out to shareholders. Form 13F data is the most reliable ownership information available to our investor relations team and that data provides a quarterly snapshot of movements in -and-out of Valvoline common stock. That information is used to gauge investor sentiment and allows our investor relations team and senior management to proactively reach -out to shareholders to help educate shareholders r egarding the Company’s strategies and to understand their views and investment thesis. The ability to proactively reach - out to shareholders is crucial to establishing constructive dialogues with the Company’s shareholder base. The Commission’s proposed cha nges to Form 13F reduces visibility into our shareholder base and diminishes our ability to proactively reach -out to all but the largest of shareholders. • Inability to monitor activist investors building ownership positions. Under the Commission’s propose d changes to the Form 13F reporting threshold, many activist hedge funds would be permitted to “go dark” making it difficult for target companies and other shareholders to determine whether a potential activist owns a stake in a target company. The lack of transparency increases the risk of activist activity and potential demands of management and the Company that may be contrary to the interests of the Company’s long -term shareholders. • Manage the overall Investor Relations function. Accurate shareholder information is vital to the effective operation of a company’s investor relations function. The loss of a significant portion of that data impedes our investor relations team’s ability to report to our senior management and board of di rectors on the ownership and changing positions in Valvoline stock. It also harms our investor relations team’s ability to plan for and prioritize shareholder outreach in the manner set forth above. Consequently, the investor relations function cannot fulf ill its mission to ensure constructive dialogue with current and potential shareholders, which we do not believe was the intent of the SEC’s proposed amendments. Consistent with Valvoline’s opposition to the proposed amendments, IHS Markit has repo rted that other public issuers also are overwhelmingly opposed to the proposed change to the Form 13F reporting threshold. In a survey of 110 issuers, representing $1.94 trillion in market capitalization (ranging from $35 million to $400 billion), IHS Mark it reported that 98% of such respondents opposed the Commission’s proposed amendments to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold. Given this opposition to the proposed amendments and the negative consequences outlined above, we believe that the Commissio n should withdraw its proposed amendments to the reporting threshold on Form 13F.

Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 RE: File Number S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: With this letter we are offering comments opposing the proposed plan by the Commission’s division of Investment Management to raise the 13(f) reporting requirement asset-threshold to $3.5 billion and exempt more than 4,500 current reporting firms. ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) is a micro-cap company in the industrials space that has been listed in the public market since 2005. As issuers of public equity, we are compelled to spend more than a million dollars annually to comply with SEC disclosure requirements that benefit our investors and potential investors. At the same time, we are made ignorant of whom our investors are, how much of our company they own, or how they trade our stock due to the lack of timeliness and transparency in the current, and arguably outdated, 13(f) process. The current SEC 13(f) filings are issued 97 days after the end of each quarter by a limited subset of public investors who trade in a market that is astonishingly efficient and operates in milliseconds. Given the gross latency of reporting inherent in the process, issuers are forced to infer or guess who their owners are and how much they own at any given time. If an investor’s trading activity is their “vote” on whether they approve of the financial performance and business operations we so painstakingly describe in our mandatory quarterly and annual reports, we feel we should be able to “count the ballots” to determine whether we are acting in accordance with their wishes. We feel the current proposal would make this already difficult task nearly impossible to accomplish, and significantly diminish its value. In 1975, when the information contained in the 13(f) was transmitted via the U.S. Postal Service, it made sense to trade off some small portion of transparency to reduce the compliance burdens on less capable investors. Today, thanks to the ease with which we can collect and transmit trading data via digital means, there is no need to throttle transparency at all; to the contrary, there is every reason to increase it. In our opinion, the current proposal by the SEC is one-sided, restrictive, and increases the potential of abuse by further limiting reporting requirements by investors. At the same time, it decreases the transparency public companies rely on for capital formation and to align themselves with the interests of their public owners. We thank the Commission for its willingness to open its proposal to public review, and for the opportunity it created to voice our opinion on whether it serves the purpose of improving the reporting process for everyone. As noted, we don’t think it does. Sincerely, Jorge Avalos Chief Financial Officer ARC O (925) 949-5100 e-arc.com / ir.e-arc.com"

(NYSE: ROK) , a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rockwell Automation employs approximately 23,000 people around the world and generated $6.7 billion in sales last year. As a publicly traded company, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 10, 2020 titled “Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers. ” While we understand the thinking around the effort to modernize threshol ds for Section 13(f) reporting by independent investment managers (Proposal) , we urge the Commission to table this effort until an alternative and comparable source of information regarding the identities of shareholders of public companies is available. We understand that changing the Section 13(f) reporting system will save costs for certain advisers that manage less than $3.5 billion in assets. But the current Proposal will harm public capital markets and investor protection , and will undermine company efforts to better align with shareholder interests . There are already limited sources of information that exist about the institutional shareholders of a company . Shareholder s are not required to identify themselves as owners of a company’s common shares unless they cross the 5% beneficial owner reporting threshold applicable to Securities Exchange Act Section 13(d) and 13(g) reporting. Th is is an unnecessarily high hurdle and an im practical source of information for shareholder engagement. By limiting this information even further , this would have a significant negative impact on shareowner engagement. A successful shareholder engagement program requires companies to know th eir shareholders . Better transparency ultimately enables better alignment with long -term shareowner interests . Privileged and Confidential Rockwell Automation 1201 S. Second Street Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53204 USA www.rockwellautomation.com Amending the Form 13F threshold would impair shareholder engagement by triggering a substantial loss of market transparency. We are particularly concerned that the Proposal will impair our ability to identify highly influential shareholders including activi st shareowners and hedge funds that , by the nature of what they are and how they invest , are typically smaller in size . If companies are only able to identify the positions of very large asset managers, we fear that companies will dedicate a disproportiona te amount of time to a limited subset of their shareholders and miss important shifts represented by these other investment style funds . For all of the reasons outlined above , we urge the SEC to wait to move forward with the Proposal until it can more broadly address the need for greater transparency. If the Commission does move forward without solving the shareholder identification problem, we request a more measured approac h at the minimum . Rather than moving from a $100 million threshold to $3.5 billion , any change should be incremental to allow market participants and the Commission to assess the impact of this loss of transparency. There is limited evidence that reporting costs are an issue for funds of this size. Rockwell Automation appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the Proposal. We believe regulatory reform efforts around reporting of public company shareholders are of critical importance, and that tr ansparency is always good for business .

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman: The undersigned companies represent the manufacturing industry in the United States. Manufacturers employ millions of hardworking women and men in all 50 states and are driving America’s economic recovery from COVID -19. The undersigned busines ses are important contributors to the manufacturing economy, ranging from small and micro -cap companies to large, multinational corporations. We are united in our dedication to creating jobs, protecting manufacturing workers, and delivering returns for our shareholders and the broader economy. We appreciate the opportunity to provide comment to the Securities and Exchange Commission on File No. S7 -08-20, the Commission’s proposed rule to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion . As publicly traded companies, we value engagement with our shareholders. Investor outreach —to both current and potential shareholders —is vital to the success of any public company. It is critical that businesse s have accurate and current information on their shareholders so they can communicate effectively with them throughout the year. Form 13F is the only reliable way for public companies to access information about their shareholders. Apart from Form 13F, shareholders generally are not required to publicly identify themselves unless they beneficially own more than 5% of a public company’s outstanding shares —a threshold that few, if any, shareholders in the typical publicly traded manufa cturer meet. As such, the data from Form 13F is the best shareholder information available to publicly traded manufacturers. The information provided about asset managers’ holdings via Form 13F is essential to manufacturers’ shareholder engagement programs and facilitates vital shareholder outreach, communication, and education. Form 13F enables public companies to share information with and receive feedback from shareholders; understand shareholders’ investing goals, styles, and time horizons; identify, reach out to , and meet with potential, new, and long -standing shareholders; and respond effectively to shareholder s’ concerns on governance, strategic, and business decisions. Being able to e ffectively conduct these critical investor relations and good governance functions is crucial to the success of publicly traded manufacturers . Without access to shareholder infor mation, businesses would be left “flying blind” in their efforts to communicate with and be responsive to their investor base. As such, we are extremely concerned that the SEC has proposed to dramatically reduce the number of asset managers required to rep ort information on their holdings via Form 13F. Exempting 89% of current 13F filers from the reporting requirement would significantly limit businesses’ ability to understand their shareholders and would meaningfully undercut the vital investor relations functions that 13F data currently supports. The proposed rollback in transparency would have a substantial impact on public companies of all sizes. If 13F information is limited or unavailable , company efforts to track and identify new investors, understand shareholders’ investing goals, and communicate with their entire shareholder base would be severely impaired . The danger is particularly acute for smaller businesses, which are likely to lose information about a higher percentage of their existing 13F filers and which lack the resources to contract with costly stock surveillance services to make up for lost 13F data . The proposed rule would also have a damaging impact on the shareholders in our businesses . Both retail and institutional investors depend on 13F data to understand the market and make informed investing decisions ; they also rely on 13F-enabled communication with the companies in which they hold shares . These important uses for 13F information would be significantly undercut by the propos ed rule. We strongly encourage the SEC to reconsi der the proposed amendments to the reporting threshold for Form 13F. The proposing release fails to account for the consequences that a reduction in transparency would have for businesses that rely on 13F information —and we believe that appropriately consi dering this impact should dissuade the Commission from adopting a 35 00% increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold. Maintaining the current level of transparency around shareholder information will protect the vital shareholder engagement efforts that support America’s thriving capital markets. Thank you for your consideration of these concerns and for your attention to the proposed rule’s serious consequences for manufacturers in America and our nation’s economic recovery and renewal.

After such a substantial increase to the threshold, large index fund managers will continue reporting under 13F while many other managers, suc h as those advising hedge funds and activist funds, will fall below the proposed threshold. We have several concerns about the proposed changes to the reporting threshold and the resulting implications. Specifically, we believe the proposed change conflict s with the applicable statute. Indeed, the resulting, limited scope of reporting managers would effectively neuter the 13F requirement created by law. It appears that the Proposed Rule is beyond the scope of the SEC’s authority with respect to 13F. Moreove r, the Proposed Rule focuses heavily on the reporting managers and does not adequately consider the effects on or needs of other market participants. Lastly, we are not convinced that the data and rationale presented in the Proposed Rule justify such a substantial increase. For example, the SEC cites a 2003 letter co -signed by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) as support for a substantially increased threshold; however, the CFA has written in strong opposition to the Proposed Rule. 2 The CFA raises many significant issues that should be considered prior to finalizing the Proposed Rule. For these reasons, as discussed in detail below, we also oppose the Proposed Rule. 1 Securities and Exchange Commission, File No. S7- 08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (Jul. 10, 2020) . 2 Comment Letter to File No. 67 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers of Consumer Federation of America, September 16, 2020. Page 2 of 5 As the largest public defined benefit pension fund in the United States (U.S.), we manage approximately $400 billion in global assets on behalf of more than 2 million public employees, retirees, and beneficiaries. Our duty to pay benefits decades into the future requires that we take a long -term view, so we support transparency in markets. We believe that policy makers and standard setters should “promote full disclosure so that financial markets provide incentives that price risk and opportunity.” 3 The Commission does not appear to have the authority to raise the statutory threshold. In 197 5, Congress adopted Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act, which requires institutions that exercise discretion over $100 million or more of covered securities (“13(f) securities”) to provide detailed holdings information to investors and the public.4 Congress authorized the SEC to expand the pool of reporting investment managers to include managers with as little as $10 million under management. This demonstrates a clear intent to allow the SEC to expand the scope of reporting managers. Importantly, C ongress did not give the SEC similar discretionary authority for raising the threshold or otherwise limit the scope of reporting managers. 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1) reads as follows: (1) Every institutional investment manager which uses the mails, or any means o r instrumentality of interstate commerce in the course of its business as an institutional investment manager and which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) or otherwis e becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of any security of a class described in subsection (d)(1) upon the purchase or sale of a security -based swap that the Commission may define by rule, having an aggregate fair market value on the last tradi ng day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission by rule, may determine , shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. Such reports shall include for each such equity security held on the las t day of the reporting period by accounts (in aggregate or by type as the Commission by rule, may prescribe) with respect to which the institutional investment manager exercises investment discretion (other than securities held in amounts which the Commiss ion by rule, determines to be insignificant for purposes of this subsection), the name of the issuer and the title, class, CUSIP number, number of shares or principal amount, and aggregate fair market value of each such security. (emphasis added) The unambiguous language of the statute does not give the SEC the discretion to increase the threshold. While we recognize that the SEC may be relying on language from a Senate report, such legislative intent is only relevant and meaningful to the extent it helps to clarify statutory language which may be ambiguous or unclear. In this case, the statutory authorization is clear. Moreover, we understand the Senate report language to indicate that the SEC would “have the authority to raise or lower” the threshold within a range of $10 million and $100 million. On the 3 CalPERS’ Governance & Sustainability Principles, September 2019 at 34. 4 15 U.S.C. § 78m(f). Page 3 of 5 other hand, if the language of the Senate report contemplates a threshold above $100 million, then it would directly conflict with the unambiguous statutory language. With the Proposed Rule, the Commission would exceed statutory authority and contravene Congressional intent, which we expect would subject the Proposed Rule to unnecessary and costly legal challenges. The Proposed Rule does not consider market participants other than the reporting institutio nal investment managers. Section 13(f) also requires the SEC to consult with certain specified federal and state regulatory authorities, national securities exchanges, and national securities organizations in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities. H owever, it does not appear that the SEC consulted with any of the above when it decided that it would rewrite the law. Additionally, the SEC has stated the importance of the information collected on Form 13F. Here are excerpts from the SEC’s Office of Insp ector General 2010 report, “Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) reporting requirements” (OIG Report): The information collected on Forms 13F has been and continues to be used by U.S. regulators, academics, the media and financial information distributors, an d investors, and other U.S. equity markets participants, as intended by Congress. The Commission’s staff use Form 13F information for a variety of research, oversight, and enforcement purposes. The Commission’s staff also use Form 13F - based academic research, for example, to analyze the Commission’s rulemaking initiatives under the federal securities laws. 5 The data that is provided by institutional investors on Form 13F is extraordinarily valuable to investors and other financial market participants. 6 Staff of our Division, notably our economists, make extensive use of Section 13(f) data.7 The excerpts above show that the SEC has articulated that the Form 13F information has value for the SEC. Congress foresaw a wide array of stakeholders would benefit from the data collected pursuant to Section 13(f) and the Commission’s past reviews have affirmed Congress’ intent. Congress predicted that individual companies would benefit from being able to identify the holders of their stock in order to communicate with s ignificant beneficial owners. Companies have voiced their opinions in comments to the SEC in opposition to the Proposed Rule. Accordingly, we have concerns about the future utility of this information under the Proposed Rule when the primary reporters will be limited to index managers. We do not believe that the Proposed Rule seriously considers the impact of the changes, particularly with respect to the loss of substantial information, on market participants, especially companies. 5 OIG Report at 7 referencing, In re Full Value Advisors, LLC, Release No. 34 -61327 (Jan. 11, 2010), at 4. 6 OIG Report at 37 and Memo from Kayla J. Gilan, deputy Chief of Staff Office of the Chairman to H. David Kotz, Inspector General. 7 OIG Report at 43 and Memo from Henry Hu, division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation to H. David Kotz, Inspector Gen eral. Page 4 of 5 We also find it troubling that the SEC does not analyze its own responsibilities with Section 13(f) and how it has executed the law. Nor does it use its own information to support its determination in the Proposed Rule. At a minimum, the Proposed Rule should address how market participants will be affected. The SEC notes how much institutional investment managers may save by not having to report, but it does not address how much it will cost stakeholders to replicate the information lost or the cost to companies when fighting off attacks by activists that may be more common when such activists no longer have to report. The data and rationale are insufficient to justify the substantial increase in the threshold. As briefly noted above, Section 13(f) requires the SEC to colle ct certain data. However, we note that the SEC did not use the data it was supposed to collect in order to justify revising Section 13(f). We find this more concerning in light of the findings in the OIG Report: Finding 1: Despite the Intent of Congress in Prescribing the Section 13(f) Reporting System that the SEC Would Make Extensive Use of the Section 13(f) Information for Regulatory and Oversight Purposes, the SEC Conducts No Continuous or Systematic Review or Analysis of the Form 13F Reports Finding 2: The Lack of Monitoring of the Form 13F information by the SEC Renders this Data Less Useful and Reliable than Congress Had Intended The other findings of the OIG report are similarly critical of how the Commission has approached Section 13(f). By the indications of the Proposed Rule, little may have changed since 2010. Taken together, we cannot be sure that the SEC has corrected the de ficiencies noted in the OIG Report. While it may be so that regulators disagree with Congressional actions, regulators cannot be allowed to rewrite a law that it does not like. The SEC has a three -part mission: Protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, an d efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. 8 “The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers . Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” 9 As previously stated, Congress fully intended to allow the number of reporting institutional investment managers to increase be cause the law provides “having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission by rule, may determine.” 10 However, the SEC is not given the authorization to increase the threshold and thereby decrease the number of reporting managers. The SEC should not use its exemptive authority to relieve institutional investment managers from providing market transparency. Furthermore, given the current size of the markets, the remaining reporters will be a small pool 8 SEC Website 9 Proposed Rule at 9. 10 15 U.S.C. § 78m(f). Page 5 of 5 of the largest index institutional investment managers. Little market information is garnered in their Form 13F Reports. Other funds such as hedge funds or acti vist funds might either fall below the threshold or restructure in order to avoid reporting. In sum, the Proposed Rule substantially diminishes the utility of Form 13F reporting. To justify the change, the SEC simply asserts that the market increased in size and that a one - to-one increase in the reporting threshold is needed in order to keep the number of reporting managers to a minimum. The SEC seems to rely on the premise that Congress intended for Section 13(f) to capture a finite pool of institutional i nvestors. Accordingly, the Proposed Rule essentially holds the number of managers constant. However, a plain reading of the statutory language indicates that Section 13(f) was intended to capture all institutional investment managers of a certain size. Certainly, Congress would have expected that this pool of investors would grow as the market grows, and if it intended something different, it would have included language clearly stating as much. Basing the change solely on market growth does not explain how investor protections are improved, market efficiency is increased, and access to capital is increased. Indeed, it seems that the proposed change would decrease the utility of a central data repository, negatively affect the body of factual data available for consideration, and thereby decrease investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. markets. This proposal does not seem to align with the mission of the SEC nor support the primary goals of the Section 13(f) disclosure program. Conclusion As the Commission acknowledges, Congress adopted Section 13(f) in order to close “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors.” 11 Unfortunately, the Proposed Rule works to increase the information gaps, leaving market participants to find other mechanisms to replace the information lost or suffer the consequences. To be clear, investors lose with the Proposed Rule. In no way does it protect investors. Companies are harmed as well. Finally, we strongly disagree with the underlying premise that only the very largest institutional investment managers should disclose their ownership interests in public companies.

The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund manages and o versees Tulane University’s $1.5 billion endowment. The Endowment seeks to provide a perpetual revenue s ource that helps meet the growing financial needs of its students, faculty, and broader Tulane co mmunity. Like most endowments, foundations, and pensions, we invest largely by allocating our capital to investment managers. We take our fiduciary duties seriously, and ensure that these managers are responsible guardians of our capital. While best practices have been established, investmen t managers have substantial flexibility over how and what they choose to repor t to us on their actual portfo lio holdings. We have found 13F filings to be one of the most valuable tools to promote transparency and manager accountability. The holding‐level detail provided by these fil ings helps us answer critical questions, a small sample of which I’ve provided below: ‐ Are there any mismatches between a fund’s stated strategy and t he types of investments in their portfolio? If we have a healthcare manager who is suddenly pur chasing tech stocks, for example, this can lead to an import ant line of questioning. ‐ Are we comfortable with the level of concentration we note amon gst the top holdings? ‐ Are we comfortable with the liquidity of the underlying holding s relative to the fund’s asset base or liquidity terms? ‐ What purchase and sale decisions does a manager make over time and why (relative to the selective information we might receive in a quarterly letter)? ‐ How does a manager’s portfolio s hift as his or her AUM grows or shrinks—what are the changes, for example, in the underlying market cap of positions? ‐ In what sectors has a manager made or lost money over the long‐ term, and how might this compare to what the manager tells us he/she does well? 9 Old Kings Hwy. South, Darien , CT 06820 tel (203) 716‐84 70 fax (203) 716‐ 8476 www.tulane.edu We recognize that the SEC has the challenging job of serving as a watchdog across all investment managers. We also understand that the large number of smaller i nvestment managers further complicates the SEC’s mission of serving as an industry watchdo g. On the other hand, endowments, foundations, and family offices o ften seek out small and medium sized managers (below $3.5bn in AUM) in whom to invest because we believe these managers can take ad vantage of inefficien cies in the market that larger funds cannot access at scale.

Investment managers al ready have the information in the 13F at their fingertips and not once in my 15 years as an allocator h ave I heard a manager complain that the 13F requirement created undue burden or expense. We pay these managers healthy management fee s to do just that, and typically the partnerships and funds managed by smaller investment firms pay the costs associated with regulatory filings, not the managers themselves. As an institutional inve stor who pays these costs regularly, we welcome the burden of these costs in exchange for the transpare ncy this filing provides us. The adoption of File Number S7‐08‐20 will severely reduce trans parency for endowments, foundations, family offices and pension funds. This reduction in transparenc y not only threatens the safety of the financial system but also places innumerable educational instit utions, non‐profits, private investors and retirees at an informational dis advantage to investment manager s. We kindly request that the SEC reconsider raising the threshold for the 13F filing. Thank you for your tim e and consideration. With Greatest Respect, Julia G.

This proposal would if enacted severely limit information available to investors and therefore reduces investor transparency. (2) Cost savings to the US public are negligible when weighed against the extent of loss of highly important information regarding corporate ownership. This is no good way to save money. If some limit on hedge fund reporting has to be imposed, then I would recommend restricting it to those firms which constitute the bottom 20% of all hedge fund investments.

I believe the current proposal to increase the threshold of reporting runs against every one of the three key reasons for the creation of the 13(f). It obscures data and reduces the investor confidence in the integrity of the US Markets. The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets"

The SEC’s proposal, which would eliminate the reporting obligations of almos t 90% of current 13F filers , would result in a significant loss of ownership transparency to our company and other public companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with our unitholder s and impede our ability to attract new long-term invest ors. The 13F filings are the only comprehensive source of quarterly ownership information available to our company and other U.S. issuers . The information from these 13F filings , which is not as timely as it could be due to the 45 -day reporting period , is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our units. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our commitment to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year . With an approximate market capitalization of approximately $2 billion for our publicly traded common units , we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify current and potential unitholder s and engage effectively with them. We estimate that approximately 45% of our current 13F filers and approximately 78% of our industry’s 13F filers fall below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable . 2 Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not o nly our largest investors but also those unitholder s with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. The loss of such a meaningful amount of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential unitholder s (such as those who have invested in peer companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. As required by the agency’s mission, we respectfully request that the SEC fully consider the impact on public company capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . For the foregoing reasons, w e respectfully request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , Nasdaq and the Society for Corporate Governance .1 Furthermore , and in an effort to enhance 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to provide more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the 45 -day reporting period and by requiring the public disclosure of short positions .

For more information, please visit www.computershare.com and www.georgeson.com . Computershare and Georgeson appreciate the opportunity to comment on the SEC’s proposal to amend the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers. We are very concerned that these changes, as proposed, will negatively impact issuers. We accordingly request that the Commission reconsider these proposed amendments to the reporting threshold , and to establish an industry roundtable to discuss and recommend steps to modernize Form 13F in a manner that balances the interests of all concerned stakeholders, including issuers . Our statistical analysis, as detailed below, shows that the p roposed change would significantly reduce issuers’ visibility of the identities of their beneficial owners. The impact will be felt most keenly by small and mid -cap issuers and closed end funds, however even the largest issuers will experience a measurable reduction in visibility of the identities of their investors. While we appreciate that transparency for issuers was not among the original purposes in enacting the filing requirement for institutional investment managers, in the past 45 years the need for issuers to be able to understand who their investors are has grown considerably. Issuers and the investing public have relied on Form 13F filings for many years, and the dramatic change proposed by the Commission would be highly detrimental. Reduced Trans parency from Amended Reporting Threshold We analyzed the application of the amended reporting threshold across a representative sampling1 of equity issuer and closed end fund clients at varying market capitalizations ( Table 1) , based on Form 13F filings covering data from the quarter ending June 30, 2020 . For equity issuers, the changed threshold would result , on average, in a loss of visibility of 49.5% of institutional investors that file Form 13F for issuers across the sample set, compared to the current threshold . As Table 1 shows, the loss of visibility of shares outstanding is greatest for small and mid -cap issuers, however even the largest issuers would lose visibility of more than 4.5% of their shares outstanding under the revised threshold, compared to their current level of visibility. Similarly, closed end fund issuers risk losing visibility of more than 14% of shares outstanding, and almost 40% of their total institutional shareholders. As detailed further below, a cross the market, the impact for issuers’ corporate governance programs and shareholder engagement will be significant.

However, the usage has evolved considerably. Issuers, investors (of all size s), regulators, analysts and academics depend on the information laid out in Form 13F filings . In 1 To perform this analysis, we divided a sample of 115 equity issuer client s into the five tiers based on market capitalization, identified in Table 1, and quantified the impact of the threshold change for the companies in each tier. Table 1 likewise summarizes our analysis of 32 closed end funds . particular, issuers utilize the data to determine who holds an interest in their company, so that they ca n then have productive engagement with their shareholders. It is vital that companies understand their investors’ viewpoints on overall governance and strategy, as well as rationales for voting decisions. Effective identification of investors is the corne rstone of shareholder engagement. It is necessary to support issuers’ active proxy solicitation efforts prior to shareholder meetings. It facilitates issuers’ comprehension of the make -up of their investor base and the interests and priorities of their investors , enabling issuers to understand the potential response of investors to various corporate strategies and associated resolutions. Critically, it provides visibility of development of positions by activist investors. This transparency allows issuers to conduct shareholder outreach with a broad range of shareholders to inform how those owners’ expectations and viewpoints compare to the position advanced by an activist. Without this transparency, activists espousing minority, but vocal, position s may carry even further outsized influence, to the detriment of long -term, now unidentifiable holders. These engagement efforts will be weakened as a result of reduced visibility of investors , if the reporting threshold is increased , with at least one stu dy showing that 86% of activist investors would no longer be required to comply with Form 13F filings2. Transparency Form 13F filings are the most effective mechanism for obtaining visibility of institutional owners currently available to issuers in the U nited States. As the Commission is perhaps aware, transparency of ownership is a major concern for issuers, yet the US market is almost uniquely opaque in this regard, with few tools available for issuers. While “Non -Objecting Beneficial Owner ” lists provide some visibility for issuers, the majority of institutional investors are “Objecting Beneficial Owners .” Likewise, Form 13D and 13G filings are informative resources in certain respects for an issuer’s few largest holders but cannot replace the exte nt of information found in 13F filings . We also note that transparency of ownership is a central theme for issuers in the current market discussions on proxy reform, through the various Working Groups established by market stakeholders at the Commission’ s request. We were therefore surprised and concerned to see such a reduction in transparency proposed for issuers. Increasing the threshold without otherwise addressing issuers’ access to information on their beneficial owners would be highly detrimental t o corporate governance. A further reduction in transparency for issuers in the United States also runs counter to international corporate governance practice. Many markets (such as the United Kingdom, France and Australia) have long provided issuers with s trong levels of visibility into their ownership. The introduction of the Shareholder Rights Directive II across the European Union has further entrenched regulatory recognition of the importance of transparency for issuers. By comparison, we are concerned that implementation of the increased Form 13F reporting threshold may negatively impact the attractiveness of a US market listing for both US and foreign issuers, particularly considering this international trend to improve transparency and better facilitate shareholder engagement. While we appreciate the Commission’s interest in minimizing the reporting burden for smaller filers, we urge the Commission to re -evaluate the impact that it would have on issuers. In our view, the detriment 2 https://ihsmarkit.com/research -analysis/secs -13f-proposal --issuer -and-investor -analysis.html to issuers was not sufficiently taken into accou nt in the proposed amendments . Given the evolution in usage and reliance upon the data provided by Form 13F filings over the past 45 years, any changes should be evaluated in light of the effect to all stakeholders. Further, modernization of the rules shou ld consider all relevant changes to the market over this time, including the increasing demands on issuers to engage with their shareholders. We would also encourage the Commission to consider further mechanisms to improve issuers’ visibility of their be neficial owners, as has been discussed within the proxy reform discussions. We draw your attention to our recommendations in the context of proxy reform, as provided to the Commission in 2019: Proxy Reform Submission 2019 . We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments and would be pleased to provide any further information required as the Commission continues its deliberations.

The Commission’s interest in modernizing 13F reporting is appreciated and MEIP agrees that the reporting structure for institutional investment managers warrants a comprehensive review and update . However, any proposals should be consistent with the SEC’s mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly and efficient markets, as well as facilitating capital formation. As the SEC itself notes, as more investors turn to the markets to help secure their futures, to pay for homes and to send children to college, that mission becomes more compelling than ever. Sadly, the proposed rule changes do not only fail to support the SEC’s mission, but in fact would degrade the order with which the SE C is charged with protecting, unambiguously damaging public companies, the investing public, as well as the markets more broadly. The implications to small -cap public life sciences companies like MEIP with market capitalizations of $1 billion or less, of w hich there are more than 400 such companies, are significant and debilitating , and include:  Distortion of equity valuations  Diminished investor engagement due to lack of transparency  Negative impact on capital formation  Enhanced risk of activism For these reasons as more fully explained below, we strongly urge the Commission to withdraw the proposal at issue and instead consider reforms that would advance the SEC’s stated mission. We propose the Commission consider the common -sense reforms that were d etailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), the New York Stock Exchange Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. Rather than allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to hide their investments in public companies , we urge the Commission to reduce the archaic 45 -day reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions, and support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure. Distortion of Equity Valuations It is widely known and recognized that smaller institutional investors, controlling a minority of funds invested in public equities, are the main determiners of share price and hence equity valuations. These smaller institutional investors generally have modera te and high turnover rates – and perhaps are more aptly referred to as “traders.” Their effect on equity valuations was recently DocuSign Envelope ID: 2A46A321-4113-4830-BC51-F6280F170234 MEI Pharma, Inc., 11455 El Camino Real, Suite 250, San Diego, CA 92130 2 confirmed in a publication by researchers from t he University of Chicago, Becker Friedman Institute for Economics and NYU Stern School of Business . Amon g its findings , the publication states: We find that hedge funds and small, active investment advisors are most influential per dollar of assets under management, while long -term investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies are least influential.1 This is highly relevant with respect to the proposed rule change because, paradoxically, it will only be the larger, generally longer term investors that are not instrumental in driving valuations that will be required to file if the propos ed rule change takes effect. The potential harm to equity valuations can be clearly illustrated by a quick look at MEIP’s institutional investor base. MEIP’s institutional investor base as of the June 30 , 2020 filing date, the latest available , shows that a bout 50% (48.17%) of MEIP’s institutional holders do not meet the $3.5 billion proposed filing threshold . While losing visibility into half our MEIP’s institutional investor base is alone shocking, the characteristics of the investors that will avoid filing if the proposed rule change goes forward are particularly disturbing. Almost all the sub $3.5 billion institutional investors a re active investors (or “traders”) . This means that a group of institutional investors constitut ing a minority of shareholders, owning only 32.37% of all MEIP stock, will be the main determin ants of equity valuation for all MEIP shareholder s while shielded from any transparency if the proposed rule were to take effect . From only this limited summary of MEIP’s investor holdings it is clear that if the proposed rule were to take effec t, this minority of “traders” that are the determinants of equity valuations for publicly traded compan ies would avoid transparency in a market system that theoretically stri ves for transparency to support efficient markets and protect individual investors . The markets should not shield a minority of institutional investors that manage a minority of the funds investing in the public markets intended to have a n even playing field for all investors and in the process potentially distort market valuations by decreasing transparency and thus market efficiency . Just this alone should dissuade the SEC from implementing the proposed rule change because it contradicts its mission and will support distortions of market equity valuations . But there are additional reasons to prevent the SEC from implementing the proposed rule change , including for the reasons that follow. Diminished Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency As noted above, MEIP’s institutional investor base as of the June 30, 2020 filing date shows that about 50% of MEIP’s institutional holders do not meet the $3.5 billion proposed filing threshold . Consequently, it is clear even after a cursory look and thi s simple analysis, MEIP will lose visibility into about half of institutional investor base. But, as also noted above, the group of institutional investors that will avoid reporting if the proposed rule takes effect is the minority of smaller institutional investors that are most impactful 1 Koijen, Ralph S. J. and Richmond, Robert and Yogo, Motohiro, Which Investors Matter for Equity Valuations and Expected Returns? (June 11, 2020).

Not being able to identify the investors that are the main determinants of stock price will have a debilitating effect on being able to communicate effici ently, address the interests and concerns of an influential group of investors in a manner that complies with best practices for investor relations and supports fair equity valuations. Additionally, MEIP uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our s enior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing or maintaining their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibil ity into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) , build a diversified shareholder base, and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. These practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets , grow our business and build value for all shareholders – including those outside the minority of our institutional investors under the $3.5 billion threshold of the proposed rule change. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation , particular ly for companies with smaller market capitalizations more likely to have smaller institutional investors as shareholders than larger capitalization companies, before proceeding with this rulemaking. If the rule were to go forward capital formation for the smaller companies, which are often the source of important innovations, would be severely and negatively impacted. Enhanced Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declin es to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission. . .. We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their curre nt financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.” Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, ""The Importance of Disclosure – For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID -19,"" April 8, 2020 .

The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record y ear for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial cris is of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position . While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership di sclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for i nvestment managers. The proposed 35 -fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the gross reven ue cap for emerging growth companies,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post -pandemic -corporate -activism . 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Acti vism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism -in-the-post -pandemic -mark et-what -you-need -to-know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepare for post -pandemic activism,” April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards -can-prepare -post -pandemic - activism . 5 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Rele ase Nos. 33 -10332; 34 - 80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017). 6 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34 -88365; File No. S7 -06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the thresho ld fo r exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 7 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a -8, File No: S7 -23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increas e the minimum holding requirement for shareholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company’s shares for at least thr ee years.)

We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take . The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuer s. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a $1 billion market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate th at the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion w ould allow 26% of our current 13F filers or 10 out of our top 100 investors to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those inst itutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable .1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are intere sted in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability t o attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors.

Overview The SEC proposes to change the minimum reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers from $100 million in U.S. equities under management to $3.5 billion and to make certain technical amendments, including requiring filers to provide additional identifying information such as security identifiers, among others. While the 13F Proposal cites the need to modernize 13F filing requirements to account for the lack of change since 1975, raising the reporting threshold would eliminate the obligation to report for nearly 90% of investment managers currently required to file 13F reports without adequately considering the impact of loss of such data to market participants. As detailed below, the 13F Proposal lacks substantive analysis of costs and benefits on what it is proposing to do. While Bloomberg supports the Commission’s stated goals of improving the data on holdings of institutional investment managers and increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, SEC Exch. Act Rel. No. 34-89290 (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf (“13F Proposal”). 2 Bloomberg – the global business, financial information, and news leader – increases access to market data by connecting market participants of all stripes to a dynamic network of information, people, and ideas. The company’s strength – quickly and accurately delivering data, news, and analytics through innovative technology – is at the core of the Bloomberg Terminal. The Terminal provides financial market information, data, news, and analytics to banks, broker-dealers, institutional investors, government bodies, and other business and financial professional worldwide.

Letter on Release No. 34-89290 / File No. S7-08-20 September 28, 2020 Page 2 of 7 markets, raising the reporting threshold is contrary to those objectives because it actually decreases transparency in the markets and will lead to diminished investor confidence. While Bloomberg opposes raising the holdings threshold, we do applaud the SEC's raising the question of whether filers should be able to use other suitable identifiers – including the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (""FIGI"") – instead of being required to use CUSIPs. We would answer with a resounding ""yes"". Not surprisingly, a regulatory mandate to use a particular product tends to raise costs and diminish innovation. Competition in the provision of identifiers should be encouraged, not only in the context of this proposal, but across the board. Presently, regulations too often preclude, rather than encourage, this constructive competition. We appreciate the Commission raising this important issue. Increasing the Minimum Reporting Threshold for Form 13F Decreases Market Transparency Increasing the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion means that nearly 90% of investment managers currently required to file Form 13F would become exempt from reporting duties.3 This significantly reduces market transparency by eliminating access to information managed by 4,500 institutional investment managers overseeing $2.3 trillion in assets.4 While the proposal aims to update reporting standards so they apply to the same proportion of the market as they did when Rule 13f-1 was first created in 1975, it lacks a viable cost-benefit analysis to justify decreasing public access to market data. It also reduces reporting obligations for some asset managers at the expense of public investors at a time where greater market transparency and access to information is more important than ever. Bloomberg shares Commissioner Allison Herren Lee’s concerns that the 13F Proposal fails to provide a thorough economic analysis of the proposed amendments and overestimates the compliance costs of the current filing requirement.5 While the SEC cites reducing regulatory burdens, compliance costs, and the risk of front running and copycat investing for what classifies as “small” investment managers6 as reasons for eliminating their reporting requirements, there is 3 See 13F Proposal at 18. 4 See NIRI Executive Alert, “SEC Proposes to Reduce Equity Ownership Transparency” (July 13, 2020), available at https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Executive-Alert/NIRI-Executive-Alert_-SEC-Proposes-to-Reduce-Equity- Ownership-Transparency-7-13-2020.pdf . 5 See Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting,” July 10, 2020, available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10 (“July 2020 Commission Lee Statement”) . 6 Under the terms of the 13F Proposal, “smaller” investment managers would encompass those with less than $3.5 billion in equities under management. The Commission’s 1971 Institutional Investor Study Report – conducted at the direction of the Congress and ultimately led to the creation of the 13F reporting requirement and threshold – classified an advisory firm as “large” if it provided advice for more than $100 million of advisory assets as of December 31, 1969. All other advisory firms were classified as “small”. See Institutional Investor Study Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 92-64, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. (1971), available at http://3197d6d14b5f19f2f440- Ms. Vanessa Countryman, Securities and Exchange Commission Bloomberg L.P. Letter on Release No. 34-89290 / File No. S7-08-20 September 28, 2020 Page 3 of 7 no concrete analysis provided by the 13F Proposal to justify those reasons. The 13F Proposal suggests that Form 13F data of smaller asset managers may more likely be used by other market participants to engage in potentially damaging behavior. However, there is no empirical data to support the suggestion that smaller managers are harmed more than larger managers by frontrunning or copycat investing. In addition, 13F filing takes place after the purchase occurs and with a 45-day lag after quarter-end, which makes frontrunning unlikely and invalidates this concern. Therefore, there is no justification for reducing transparency by reducing smaller asset managers’ reporting obligations over those of larger managers. The 13F Proposal also argues that protecting smaller asset managers from potentially harmful behavior by eliminating the 13F filing requirement would allow smaller managers to compete with larger managers by leveling the competitive field, and investors may subsequently benefit.7 Yet, there is no quantifiable analysis on what those benefits would be and whether they would outweigh the costs associated with decreased transparency in market data. In addition, private funds with at least $150 million in assets under management are still required to report asset holdings in Form PF under the Dodd-Frank Act.8 Eliminating the13F reporting obligation would not necessarily reduce costs for the smaller asset managers because they still have to file Form PF, although the frequency of the Form PF reporting depends on the size of the fund. Form PF information is not made publicly-available. Eliminating a vast majority of the 13F filers by raising the reporting threshold will give the SEC a narrower pool of data to conduct risk-based examinations for asset concentration, while taking away transparency from the investing public. 13F data is also critical for issuers in understanding their shareholders and promoting shareholder engagement, but the 13F Proposal does not discuss how these issuers would be impacted by the proposed changes and what costs they would have to bear as a result. There is a similar lack of consideration given to the pool of users of 13F data that the Commission acknowledges to include academics, market researchers, the media, attorneys pursuing private securities class-action matters, market participants, and even the Commission itself.9 Even though the 13F Proposal concedes that 13F data can be used to assist individuals in making investment decisions, investment managers managing assets, and corporate issuers interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly-traded stock, there is no analysis on how 5e13d29c4c016cf96cbbfd197c579b45.r81.cf1.rackcdn.com/collection/papers/1970/1971_0310_SECInstitutionalInv estor_25.pdf , at 64 n.1 (“Institutional Investor Study”). 7 See 13F Proposal at 39. 8 New registration and reporting requirements for private fund advisers under the Dodd-Frank Act have allowed the SEC to gather considerable data on these advisers and their funds to increase transparency and protect investors. In her October 2015 keynote address at the Managed Fund Association, then Chair of the SEC Mary Jo White remarked that “excessive leverage, lack of liquidity, and asset concentrations have in the past been at the root of financial crises, and we now have the regulatory tools to help better identify and appropriately mitigate potential problems.” See Chair Mary Jo White, “Keynote Address at the Management Fund Association: ‘Five Years On: Regulation of Private Fund Advisers After Dodd-Frank,’” October 15, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/white-regulation-of-private-fund-advisers-after-dodd-frank.html . 9 See 13F Proposal at 22.

Letter on Release No. 34-89290 / File No. S7-08-20 September 28, 2020 Page 4 of 7 these users would be impacted by eliminating their access to data. It is ill-advised to eliminate a large swath of currently available information to the detriment of market transparency, especially in the absence of any real analysis that examines the impact of the 13F Proposal to the markets and market participants as a whole. Rationale for the Current 13F Threshold In proposing to raise the $100 million reporting threshold, the SEC cites the costs and burdens associated with reporting for small managers and unchanged reporting threshold since the inception of the reporting requirement. However, both the statutory language and legislative record of section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 show that the statute actually intended to “require, on a continuous basis, reports and disclosures from all types of institutional investors” (emphasis added).10 In fact, the 1975 Amendments Senate Report cited by the 13F Proposal suggests that the $100 million threshold was initially set as a temporary measure in consideration of reporting costs and burdens, as it states that, by “limiting initially the impact of the reporting provisions to the largest institutional managers, the institutional disclosure program could be implemented rapidly with the least amount of unnecessary costs and burdens.”11 The 1975 Amendments Senate Report refers to the $100 million threshold as an “initial” level and notes that the Commission could lower the threshold to as low as $10 million.12 This shows that the intent behind 13F reporting requirement was to decrease the reporting threshold over time to capture holdings information from all types of institutional investors, whether small or large, not to increase it. In fact, the Commission may lack the authority to raise the reporting threshold to over $100 million based on the statutory text of section 13(f) reporting requirements. As also noted by Commissioner Lee, a plain reading of the rule permits the SEC to lower the threshold but does not grant similar authority to raise it.13 The possible lack of the Commission’s authority to raise the reporting threshold – supported by legislative history of section 13(f) as discussed above – is not addressed by the 13F Proposal. Public Demand for 13F Information As acknowledged in the 13F Proposal, the pool of users of 13F data has expanded over the years to include not only regulators and the public, but also academics, market researchers, the media, 10 See Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 14852 (June 15, 1978) [43 FR 26700, 26701 (June 22, 1978), available at https://tile.loc.gov/storage- services/service/ll/fedreg/fr043/fr043121/fr043121.pdf (“13F Adopting Release”). 11 See Securities Act Amendments of 1975: Hearings on S. 249 before a Sub Comm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking, House and Urban Affairs, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (S. Report No. 94-75) (1975), at 86 (“1975 Amendments Senate Report”). 12 Id. at 86. 13 See July 2020 Commissioner Lee Statement.

Letter on Release No. 34-89290 / File No. S7-08-20 September 28, 2020 Page 5 of 7 attorneys pursuing private securities class-action matters, and market participants, including institutional investors themselves, who use data to enhance their ability to compete.14 There is a wide demand for the data, especially in an economic climate where greater transparency in the markets is being demanded. At Bloomberg, we certainly see the wide and consistent demand for this data. 13F data is used in many Bloomberg applications and products. Our clients on both the buy-side and sell-side require 13F data in their daily workflows to help review filings, individual holdings changes, aggregated holdings data, to help drive business, and to facilitate competitor, company and historical analysis. Indicative of the critical utility of this data, during the four annual peak filing seasons consumption of 13F data can increase by over 500%. Providing Information and Possible Use of Competing Identifiers While there are insufficient reasons to support raising the reporting threshold as currently contemplated by the SEC, its proposal to require filers to provide additional identifying information is a step in the right direction to modernize 13F disclosures. The SEC proposes to allow a 13F filer to provide its number assigned by FINRA’s Central Registration Depository (“CRD”) system or by the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (“IARD”) system, as well as its SEC filing number, so that the users of 13F data would be able to identify a filer’s other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over reportable securities more easily.15 The 13F Proposal also considers allowing alternatives to CUSIP number such as the FIGI for each security. Rather than to specify the use of a particular identifier, the Commission should let filers choose the identifier to be reported in Form 13F by setting out the appropriate metrics for their use. These identifiers would add value to the 13F data by increasing visibility and quality of 13F data for its users, thereby increasing market transparency. Specifically for regulators and others that consume such reporting, enabling the use of open data would greatly serve the transparency needs and access to basic, descriptive information by individual investors, small businesses, and national, local and regional jurisdictions. There are numerous identification systems for financial instruments in place, and many times these are embedded within firms' infrastructure, typically because of legacy technology practices and prior lock-in to a specific identifier forced by a data provider. This fact is many times used as reason “not to change”. As a data provider, this is something we have looked to change in the marketplace as it works against better quality data and innovation. The key is to provide a method of interoperating with legacy systems while improving functionality with new systems. Bloomberg has long been a proponent of the FIGI, a flexible identifier that catalogs financial instruments across global asset classes. Developed by Bloomberg, the FIGI accounts for many types of financial instruments that arise, expire, and change on a daily basis. The FIGI is available free of charge for use by all market participants unlike other similar identifiers that may 14 See 13F Proposal at 22. 15 See id. at 34.

Bloomberg placed FIGIs into the public domain with no commercial terms or restrictions on usage. The FIGI is currently managed by the Object Management Group, an independent computer industry standards consortium.16 FIGI enables interoperability between other identification systems and does not force use of a single identification system. Enabling interoperability between different identifications systems has an onward effect of lower costs when interacting between legacy systems that may be dependent upon a single identifier and newer systems that have more modern architecture approaches. Interoperability lowers complexity, dependencies, and costs of interacting with inflexible legacy systems, managing data and data quality, and sharing critical and universal information. By allowing users choice, the issues surrounding licensing and de facto monopolies may finally be addressed. It is inconceivable that the core data necessary to operate in financial services - that of exchanging an asset between entities – carry material costs to simply name those two things with no other value add than a code and a name. For example, the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), a non-proprietary data element, has partially addressed this on the identification of entities on government contracting data. Indeed, obstacles to the use of LEI – such as mandates to use the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) for government reporting which carries licensing fees – drew deserved criticism. However, the problem for investors relating to identifiers for instruments is even worse than for entities, as the licensing and costs associated with mandated, licensed, and restricted use of identifiers in the financial instrument space dwarf the industry costs and concerns that surrounded the DUNS number licensing. Providing alternatives to the industry, based on open data principles like the MIT Open Source license that does not restrict noncommercial nor commercial use of the data, provides methods for the industry to shed unnecessary costs and encourage innovation and transparency, especially where those other identifiers may serve better purpose, or provide additional functionality. Market forces can make the correct determination regarding different licensing methods that restrict use, or may allow restrictions in commercial applications, like the Creative Commons license. Regardless, not allowing optionality effectively creates a regulatory compulsed monopoly by forcing the industry to use a single, licensed, and restricted identification system. CUSIPs change and are re-used over time. CUSIP numbers change for a variety of reasons, including simple name changes. This can have significant impact in traceability. The base of the CUSIP is meant to identify a specific issuer, but due to the code structure, one issuer may have multiple different “base” codes – perhaps hundreds. All the base codes for a single entity would need to change for a name change, and therefore every instrument based on those base codes will change. Year to year, the same instrument may then be reported on the Form 13F under different identifiers, creating data quality issues, transparency issues, traceability problems, and making oversight and analysis impossible. Further, since a “matured” CUSIP can be re-used in the future, this may create false linkages, further complicating matters. FIGI, by contrast, does not change over time and can actually be utilized in data lineage to capture the different identifiers 16 See Bloomberg ID Symbology Factsheet, available at https://web.archive.org/web/20120617020536/http://cdn.gotraffic.net/enterprise/pdf/id_symbology_fact_sheet.pdf .

Letter on Release No. 34-89290 / File No. S7-08-20 September 28, 2020 Page 7 of 7 that exist, over time, to identify the same financial instrument. Additionally, it can be used as a sanity check on identifiers that are re-used. In addition, CUSIPs do not cover the entirety of the financial instruments to be reported. Options, specifically, and other instrument types are not covered by CUSIP numbers. As such, reporting is done typically using the CUSIP of the listed equity. This is not an accurate representation for the purposes of 13f reporting of exposures, risks, and actual holdings. There are other identifiers, such as FIGI, as well as others that provide broader and more accurate coverage in many of these asset classes. In considering the best data quality to be provided to the SEC and the industry to perform functions related to the 13F data, permitting managers to choose the data identifiers they use would be beneficial to the industry as a whole, in regards to transparency, increased data quality, removing unnecessary and burdensome costs, and enabling competition. Conclusion For all of the reasons discussed above, we urge the SEC to withdraw the 13F Proposal. Any and all amendments to Rule 13F should be made in consideration of enhancing transparency and accountability in the markets, yet the current 13F Proposal actually decreases transparency. The 13F Proposal does contain some elements that are moving in the right direction toward modernization, such as allowing filers to potentially have the option to choose a security identifier as a part of disclosure, rather than to mandate a specific identifier, and the SEC should explore these options not only in this context, but across the board. We appreciate the Commission’s willingness to consider comments on the 13F Proposal and would be pleased to discuss any questions that the Commission may have with respect to this letter. Thank you. Very truly yours, Gregory Babyak Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, Bloomberg L.P."

We are one of the largest investor-owned pur e play water and wastew ater utilities based on estimated rate base in the United States, prov iding life-saving and high-quality water service to nearly 1.5 million people. Not only is our prod uct life-saving, it is essential to public health, a high standard of living, and economic growth. While SJW Group appreciates and supports the Securities Exchange Commission’s (the “Commission”) efforts and intent to modern ize the regulatory apparatus related to Rule 13F, we strongly oppose the Proposal in its cu rrent form, echoing the position of the many other public issuers, investors, institutions, scholars, and in dividuals. We joined 380 other public issuers by signing on to the New York Stock Exchange’s (“NYSE”) letter to the Commission dated September 21, 2020 by which th e NYSE strenuously objects to the Proposal in its current form to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion.1 In our view, if implemented, the Proposal wi ll have detrimental effects on (i) market transparency and our insight into our institu tional shareholder constituency, (ii) effective shareholder engagement, and (iii) our ability to attract new investors and raise capital from institutional investors. Effect on Transparency Under the current Proposal, nearly 90 percen t of current 13F filers would no longer be required to file, thereby reduci ng investor access to valuable information provided in the 1 See NYSE Letter to the Commission dated Se ptember 21, 2020, pp.1, 14, available at: https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7- 08-20/s70820-7797941-223589.pdf . Vanessa Countryman September 28, 2020 Page 2 reports such as the full institutional compositi on of our share holdings. Investors use this information when making investment decisions, and we believe that the Proposal is at odds with the Commission’s statement on capital market transparency which reads in relevant part: “The laws and rules that govern the secu rities industry in the United States derive from a simple and straightforw ard concept: all investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should have access to certain basic facts … Only through the steady flow of timely, comprehensive, and accurate information can people make sound investmen t decisions. The result of this information flow is a far more acti ve, efficient, and transparent capital market that facilitates the capital fo rmation so important to our nation's economy.2 Similar to the impact on other public issu ers, the Proposal would cause SJW Group to lose the transparency we have into a significant percentage of our institutional investors holding a significant percentage of our outstanding shares. This loss of transparency due to the Proposal will erode the very concept of e quality of information that the Commission is responsible to promote and enforce. Effect on Shareholder Engagement Trust and respect are among our company’s valu es. Because we take our values very seriously, it is important for us to listen to the thoughts an d opinions of our shareholders regardless of the size of their holdings. Specifi c to SJW Group’s share holder base, the Proposal would result in approximately 30 percent of our outstanding shar es ceasing to report on Form 13F. This would have a detrimental effect on our investor relations f unction. We would lose our ability to meaningfully and effectively enga ge shareholders in a way that is not cost- prohibitive because we would no longer be able to confirm their identity in a way that we could prior to the change that would result from the Prop osal. Due to this lost information, increased market surveillance services, senior management time and effort, and human resources will be required to execute our investor relations directives. We w ould lose important dialog with shareholders on any number of issues that may be important to them such as environmental, social, and governance matters. Effect on Capital Formation The Proposal may impede our ability to attrac t and raise new capital from institutional investors, as our knowledge of who holds our stock and our peer s’ stock will be significantly reduced. With the loss of a si gnificant amount of valuable investor information publicly available through Form 13F, we will know less a bout who is purchasing our shares and less about the types of investors that may be inclined to invest in SJW Group. Our ability to prioritize senior management’s time and our comp any’s resources to engage certain types of investors will be greatly diminished. Institut ional investment managers will know less about 2 https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html .

Certain of our investor engagement activities will become significantly more challenging and others will disappear altogether with the implementation of the Propos al in its current state. What SJW Group Recommends and Requests SJW Group joins the recommendations of the National Investor Relations Institute (“NIRI”) and supports the Comm ission’s efforts to modernize the Section 13(f) regulatory scheme to promote timely disclosures such as moving to a 15-day repo rting window from the current 45-day window and movi ng to monthly from quarterly reporting under Rule 13F.3 We also join the NYSE’s recommendation that the Commission assemble a working group consisting of stakeholders who will be able to recommend Rule 13F amendments that work for all such stakeholders.4 We believe that the Commission can accomplish modernization without reducing transparency and thereby avoi ding the deleterious effects on issuers like SJW Group, the investment community, and on the U.S. capital markets. SJW Group therefore respectfully requests that the Commission withdraw the Proposal in its current form and adopt the NIRI and NYSE recommendations stated above. Sincerely, Eric W. Thornburg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 3 NIRI Letter to the Commission dated August 28, 2020, p.1, stating “…we urge the Commission to reduce the archaic 45-day reporting period…and support legislatio n to provide for monthly disclosure.” available at: https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7- 08-20/s70820-7709057-222930.pdf . 4 See NYSE Letter, p.5."

Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 rule-comments@sec.gov Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: We hereby respectfully submit our comments on the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENTA) is small/mid-cap biotechnology company whose mission is to discover and develop lifesaving treatments for viral infections and liver diseases with large patient populations and no current treatment options. We have a track record of success in drug development. Glecaprevir, a protease inhibitor discovered by Enanta, is sold by AbbVie in numerous countries as part of its leading treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET® (ex-U.S.) (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir). After being treated with MAVYRET, close to one million people who had hepatitis C are now cured. We are also working on cures for hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and SARS-CoV-2, as well as the liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, more commonly known as NASH. As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts – as it is the only available accurate source of institutional holdings. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency regarding these holdings, significantly undermining our investor engagement. Small and mid-cap companies such as Enanta rely on our shareholders to be engaged in understanding our business so that they will support and drive forward our potentially lifesaving products for patients in need. The proposed rule might also encourage the proliferation of smaller funds because they would be able to hide under the much higher disclosure threshold now proposed. Based on reporting data as of June 30, 2020, there were 225 institutional funds holding 18,431,933 shares of Enanta, or 91% percent of our total shares outstanding. If the proposal were enacted, we would lose visibility on approximately 25% of our institutional shareholders, including 20% of our top 20 shareholders. Moreover, some of the smaller funds that would fall below the disclosure threshold have the capacity to take disproportionately large positions. For example, one of our top ten holders has built a highly concentrated portfolio. Though they report only about $350M in AUM, this is distributed across a small number of companies, and they report a nearly $40M stake in Enanta (3.8% of our outstanding stock). Understanding how this particular shareholder is behaving is of great importance to us, as their trading behavior has the potential to have outsized impact on our stock price. Without a 13F filing, we would not even know who they are, much less how much stock they own and have traded. Beyond just our existing shareholders, we believe that this proposal would seriously jeopardize our shareholder engagement efforts by excluding more than 5,000 investment managers – or nearly 90% of all 13F filers – from disclosure. Like many of our peer companies, we use 13F data to conduct investment targeting each quarter by analyzing which investment managers own shares in peer companies but don’t yet own Enanta, as well as to check the 13F filings to assess the success of our past outreach efforts. Having information on the majority of filers – including the 5,000+ investment managers that would be excluded under the Commission’s current proposal -- is critical to our ability to identify a wide swath of potential new holders, and we worry that we would not have access to key insights that could inform both our outreach and investor engagement strategies. Additionally, the Commission’s proposal would negatively impact our ability to assess the success of our past outreach efforts. The long-term impact on the public markets could be detrimental to the U.S., as this proposal will deter private companies from going public, or prompt them to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency around reporting disclosures. Further, this proposal would significantly impact the biotechnology industry. By discouraging biotech companies from being public, it could impact the number of companies with resources to discover and develop lifesaving treatments. We respectfully ask that the Commission step back to reconsider the implications of this proposed rule, and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer now than ever, and the proposed amendments to Form 13F would be a tremendous mistake at a time when shareholders generally are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Sincerely, Jay R. Luly, Ph.D. President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

John S. Rhodes,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223794.htm,,"Sep. 28, 2020 I do NOT agree with this... I want as much information as possible. ~ John S. Rhodes -- -- -- -- -- 1) 13F Filing Costs For Managers Are Negligible The SEC's main rationale for the proposal is that it would provide relief for smaller managers. It argues that smaller managers that would no longer file 13Fs would save direct compliance costs that ""could range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager."" One hedge fund told us that at worst they see around $3,500 in costs per quarter to file a 13F, or around $14,000 per year, just below the low-end of the SEC's estimates. Another hedge fund noted that costs and time associated with filing 13Fs are negligible. Any 'relief' that would fall to smaller managers is de minimis, at best. Examining a hypothetical scenario of firms currently most impacted showcases this: a firm managing $100 million with only a 1% management fee and no performance fee theoretically earns $1 million in revenue a year. Taking the SEC's highest estimate of yearly filing costs ($30,000) and dividing that by the firm's hypothetical yearly revenue ($1 million) means that annual filing costs would be only 3% of revenue. And using the SEC's own estimates, that's the worst case scenario since it's the smallest firm required to file a 13F. A $500 million firm in the same scenario would only spend 0.6% of its revenue on 13F filings a year, while a $1 billion firm would only spend 0.3% of revenue on 13F filings a year, and so on. Given the technological advancements implemented by the SEC such as XBRL and automation, it's easier and cheaper than ever to submit a 13F. Filings are straightforward and not time consuming. 2) It's Hard To Front-Run Someone 6 Weeks Later The proposal argues that there are also ""indirect costs faced by smaller managers, such as those associated with potential front-running."" A frontrunner is defined as: one who trades “in front of an expected trade by another investor, thereby making the same trade on the terms the other investor would otherwise have got.” 13Fs are filed with the SEC 45 days after quarter-end. It's hard to front-run someone if you're receiving the information of their actions six weeks later. This argument does not hold weight and would only apply to unique situations such as illiquid shares. The time-delayed reporting of holdings via 13F filing already nullifies the vast majority of any potential front-running. 3) Negative Consequences for Smaller Managers The SEC must also consider the negative ramifications for smaller managers who would no longer file 13Fs. Many limited partners utilize 13Fs to corroborate portfolio level details of managers they're invested in. This helps prevent another Madoff situation and furthers transparency. It would also reduce small manager discovery. One institutional allocator told us that under the proposal, it would be increasingly difficult for them to consider investing in smaller managers due to the lack of transparency that otherwise aides in monitoring of potential managers to allocate capital to. 4) Drastically Reduces Transparency & Limits Future Academic Research The loss of 90% of 13F filers and $2.3 trillion of investment holdings will drastically reduce market transparency and should be reason enough to reject the proposal. It would also hinder academic research about markets and securities. In a world that's becoming more data-driven by the day, going in the opposite direction is not progress. 5) Capital Formation Exists in Current Setup An argument can be made that the fact that X respected investor invests in Y stock leads to capital formation because other investors are then more inclined to examine and potentially invest in a company they might otherwise not have known about or bothered to look at. This is particularly the case in small caps, where there's less sell-side coverage and less eyeballs on the companies in general. So capital formation can be achieved in the current structure because these managers are disclosing stakes in said companies. And again, due to the 45-day lag for disclosure, they are insulated from front-running. And as far as we're aware, most investors want other people to be interested in and to buy the stocks they've already built stakes in. Increased demand can lead to an increase in share price, thus benefiting the investor that already built a position, not burden them with increased costs as the proposal suggests. Idea sharing will happen regardless of the proposal or not via idea dinners, conferences, passing around quarterly letters, instant/direct messages, email, word of mouth, etc. Humans by nature are mimetic beings. 6) Investors & Companies Won't Know The Shareholder Base; Public Companies Will See Increased Costs & Time Removing 90% of 13F filers drastically reduces the data available to companies as to who their shareholder base is, especially in small and mid cap names. While major holders are revealed via 13D, 13G, and Form 4 filings, the rest of the shareholder base would become opaque. When asked if the proposal would result in increased costs and time for their publicly traded company, one head of investor relations at a small cap replied, ""Definitely."" They also noted they're ""not entirely sure how to prove who is actually a (share)holder"" for companies that don't pay a dividend, while companies that do pay one can glean some potential insight. Another investor relations professional said that the proposal would add costs for their company each year because they'll have to pay a firm to analyze trading activity in their shares to figure out the rest of the shareholder base. And even then, this data wouldn't be accurate or even complete. Investors also often want to know who their fellow shareholders are, particularly when it comes to hedge fund 'crowding.' Also, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) submitted a letter on behalf of 237 publicly traded companies, 26 investor relations consulting firms, and five industry associations. All of them oppose the SEC's proposal. This includes the likes of Sherwin-Williams, Mastercard, Chipotle, FedEx, Procter & Gamble, Marriott, Delta Air Lines, among many others. Lastly, the NYSE along with 381 undersigned public companies also sent a letter opposing the proposal. 7) Commissioner Allison Herren Lee Opposes the Proposal Via a statement published on the SEC's website here, she writes: ""I am concerned that the projected cost savings in today’s proposal are greatly overstated and wholly inconsistent with the Commission’s past analysis—and, importantly, that the actual cost savings do not justify the loss of visibility into portfolios controlling $2.3 trillion in assets. Additionally, the Commission’s assertion of authority to raise the threshold conflicts with the plain text in the Exchange Act that requires us to collect the information. Specifically, section 13(f)(1) withholds authority from the Commission to raise the threshold, and the proposal fails to address that conflict."" 8) Negative Public Response In a poll asking if the SEC's proposal was a good idea or not, 75% of respondents said it was a bad idea and 25% said it was a good idea. A follow-up poll asked what the 13F filing threshold should be if the SEC is deadset on raising the limit: 62% of respondents said $500 million 29% of respondents said $1 billion 5% of respondents said the proposed $3.5 billion 4% of respondents said $5 billion or higher Not to mention, the overwhelming majority of public comments the SEC has received thus far regarding the proposal have vehemently opposed it. Here's a link to all the comments. Additionally, here are a just a few of the headlines/articles reacting negatively to the proposal: - Financial Times: SEC disclosure change would allow activists to 'go dark', lawyers warn - Bloomberg: Goldman warns SEC proposal could shroud hedge fund crowding - Nasdaq: President of Nasdaq says transparency is at risk with proposed changes to form 13F - Harvard Law Forum on Corporate Governance: Adoption of the SEC’s current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company’s institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis - Columbia Law School Blog on Corporations and the Capital Markets: Why the SEC's proposal to amend rule 13f-1 should fail - National Investor Relations Institute: An average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list - IHS Markit: An astounding 86% of (activist investors) would no longer be required to file 13F's - CNBC: Jim Cramer rips SEC's proposed rule change for institutional investors 9) Proposal Goes Against Original 13F Goals & SEC's Own Mission Here are the original goals of the 13F (from page 9): ""The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets."" A higher reporting threshold resulting in a drastic reduction in the amount of data does not 'improve the body of factual data.' It does the exact opposite. Reduced transparency as a result of the proposal would decrease investor confidence, not increase it as the original goal states. And the repository of historical data would be severely impaired going forward. The SEC's own website lists its mission as: ""The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. The SEC strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public's trust."" The proposal severely reduces transparency, which does not protect investors. Such reduced transparency also erodes the environment of public trust that the SEC aims to achieve. If the SEC is deadset on raising the filing threshold for the sake of modernization or to reduce its own burden, utilizing the inflation metric and setting the threshold at ~$500 million would reduce the number of filers by 50% (thus reducing any burdens on both the SEC & the smallest managers) while maintaining more transparency. The poll above also shows this is more palatable than the proposal's $3.5 billion threshold. Simply put though, the negatives associated with the proposal greatly outweigh any perceived positives."

Country man, We are law professors who teach and st udy securities regulation. We write to draw the Commissio n’s attention to a critical legal error in its recent proposal to raise the 13F reporting threshold. 1 The plain text of Exchange Act § 13(f)(1) seems to establish $100 million as a hard ceiling on the reporting thre shold. That provision requir es the Commission to set a reporting threshold “of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) ….”2 This language seems to mean that the Commission can lower the threshold below $100 milli on but may not raise it. The Commission ’s proposal suggests that § 13(f) (3) grant s the SEC authority to exempt any “class” of managers from these reporting requirements .3 Using this authority, the Commission seems to be arguing that it can “exempt ” the “class ” of managers with assets between $100 million and $3.5 billion from compliance with the reporting requirement without actually raising the reporting threshold. Some have expressed ske pticism that general exemptive authority can really be used to get around an express and specific statutory command. Commissioner Allison Herren Lee 1 One of the undersigned authors has previously presen ted the substance of the legal analysis contained in this letter . See Alexan der I. Platt, The SEC ’s Proposal To Raise The § 13(f) Reporting Threshold Rests On A Misinterpretation Of The Provision’s L egislative History , YALE J. ON REG.

Reg. 46,016 , 46,018 (Jul. 31, 2018) (“Proposed Rule ”) (“section 13(f)(3) authorizes the Commission t o exempt any manager or class of managers from the reporting requirements of section 13(f). ”). 2 objected that “using exemptive authority in this way would vitiate the limit that Congress placed on our a uthority in the plain language of Section 13(f)(1) ” and would “in effect . . . rewrite the statute to reflect the opposite meaning from its plain language.”4 Perhaps anticipating these objections , the Commission ’s proposal offers one additional and critical piece of evidence in support of its interpretation: a key quotation from a 1975 Senate Banking Committee report stating that the provision gives the Commission “authority to raise or lower” the threshold.5 The very big problem with this evidence is that the 1975 Senate Banking Committee was analyzing an earlier, materiall y different version of the provision than the one that Congress subsequently enacted. That earlier version required that the SEC set a threshold of “at least $100,000,000 or such othe r amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) ….”6 The Senate Banking Committee’s understanding that this provision would have allowed the SEC to raise or lower the threshold is unremarkable; i ndeed, it is hard to construe the operative language (“such other amount”) otherwise . Under this version of the provision, Congres s would have merely suggest ed a $100M threshold while granting the Commission a license to move the threshold up or down as it saw fit. But this language never became law . Shortly a fter the Senate passed this bill,7 the House passed a different version requiring the SEC set the reporting threshold at “at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) ….”8 The House’s substitution of “lesser” for “other ” is the whole ballgame .9 It converts the $100 million from a mere sugge stion into a hard ceiling above which the Commission is not authorized to go. After the House passed th is version, a Conference Committee was convened and stuck to the House version of this provision.10 As enacted – and to this day – the operative statutor y threshold is “$100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) ….”11 In sum, we believe t he legal theory articulated in the Commission ’s proposal rel ies on a misinterpretation of the statute’s legislative history. Not only does the c ited Senate Banking Committee report fail to support the SEC’s proposal, it actually indicates that the 1975 Congress rejected language (“such other amount”) that would have authorized the SEC to raise the reporting threshold in favor of languag e (“such l esser amount”) that seems to preclude this. 4 U.S. SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, Statement on th e Proposal to Substantially Reduc e 13F Reporting (Jul. 10, 2020) https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020- 07-10. 5 Proposed Rul e, supra note 3, at 46,018 (quoti ng S.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: Proposed Rule: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers ; Release No. 34 - 89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Ms. Countryman: The National Mining Association (“NMA”) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) proposed rule, “Reporting Threshold for Institutiona l Investment Managers.” 85 Fed. Reg. 46,016 (July 31, 2020). NMA is a national trade association whose members include the producers of most of the nation’s coal, metals, industrial and agricultural minerals; the manufacturers of mining and mineral process ing machinery, equipment and supplies; and the engineering and consulting firms, financial institutions, and other firms serving the mining industry. Among NMA ’s members are publicly traded companies listed in the United States that will be directly impact ed by the proposed rule. NMA’s members regularly use the information filed quarterly by institutional investment managers in the 13F reports for multiple purposes , including in effectively managing their investor relations programs and supporting capital formation and long -term growth for their businesses. NMA strongly opposes the SEC’s proposal to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion. Raising the threshold to $3.5 billi on would eliminate reporting for over 89 percent of all current filers. For example, under the reduced threshold only 549 of the 5,293 institutions who filed 13Fs in the first quarter would file in 2020 . As Commissioner Allison Heren Lee rightfully recognized in her public statement opposing the proposal, the SEC would drastically reduce the number of 13F filers and in turn negatively impact public access to market information and constrain financial trans parency.1 1 See Commissioner Allison Heren Lee, “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting” (July 10, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement /lee-13f-reporting - 2020 -07-10. PAGE 2 National Mining Association 101 Constitution Avenue, NW | Suite 500 East | Washington, DC 20001 | (202) 463 -2600 The SEC missed an opportunity with this rulemaking to increase transparency and visibility of markets and holdings. SEC failed to heed the calls of investors and companies to truly modernize this reporting program by reducing the reporting period from 45 days to 15 days, changing the reporting frequency to monthly, or requiring the disclosure of short positions, and other reforms that would provide real benefits to publicly traded companies and other stakeholders. Inst ead, the SEC is proposing a rule that benefits a limited segment of investment managers and those benefits are estimated to be only $15,000 to $30,000 annually per institution. The benefits of the proposal clearly do not outweigh the drawbacks of eliminati ng important information relied upon by companies and U.S. issuers for decades. If promulgated, the SEC will impede a company’s ability to engage with shareholders and attract new long -term investors, as well as deprive companies of important and timely in formation about activist hedge funds and other activist investors. SEC’s Proposal Will Significantly Reduce Transparency The 13F reports provide the best and only reliable source of ownership information to publicly traded companies. As the Commission knows, shareholders generally are not required to publicly identify themselves unless they beneficially own more than 5 percent of a public company’s outstanding shares. This scenario is not typical, making Form 13F the sole source of public information for many companies . Without 13F data, companies may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position . For many companies, the 13F d ata from more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold is the most valuable, especially for small and mid-cap issuers. The information found in 13F reports cannot simply be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms as even these compan ies rely on the quarterly 13F data in their research efforts. Moreover, for smaller companies, stock surveillance services are cost prohibitive. SEC’s Proposal Will Significantly Undermine Issuer -Investor Engagement Since 1978, when the SEC implemented the reporting requirement of section 13(f), a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies with whom they invest has occurred . Investors are increasingly active in engaging with issuers on important governance, s trategic, and business decisions. In response , companies are more engaged than ever in investor relations to ensure concerns are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. NMA’s member companies value this engagement. The information provided in 13F allows our members to better understand and communicate with shareholders. Yet, t he SEC’s proposal would blunt this engagement by severely limit ing the ability of companies to regularly engage with and know their sharehold er base . For example, companies rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings to prioritize which investors the C -suite executives or directors should meet with during the year . Companies use this information to analyze shareholder hol dings , understand PAGE 3 National Mining Association 101 Constitution Avenue, NW | Suite 500 East | Washington, DC 20001 | (202) 463 -2600 shareholder portfolios , and identify new investors. By raising the threshold for reporting, the SEC will greatly reduce this visibility into the shareholder base that is needed for critical outreach, communication, and education efforts. Eliminating the disclosure of over $2.3 trillion in assets would have serious ramifications for continued and effective issuer -investment enga gement , especially by small and mid -cap companies that have a greater percentage of smaller investors who would evade disclosure. For example, NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC., an NMA member, recently filed comments on the SEC’s proposal, providing on-the-ground impacts to their company .2 According to NOVAGOLD, the SEC proposal “would allow 117 or 40.6 [percent] of their current 13F filers to avoid disclosure ” and “would result in a significant loss of market transparency .” As a small -to-mid cap company, NOVAGOLD is especially concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair their ability to identify their most active shareholders and hedge fun ds and engage effectively with them. The same can be said for many companies . According to an IHS Markit analysis of the potential impact on the Russell 3000, an average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list .3 The SEC must preserve the ability to effectively conduct outreach and engagement with smaller investors by withdrawing this proposed rule. SEC’s Proposal Will Negatively Impact Capital Formation and Increase the Ri sk of Activism NMA is concerned that the loss of data and decreased investor engagement will impede a company’s ability to attract long -term institutional investors. Small and mid -cap companies rely heavily on 13F data to help them identify prospects and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts. To effectively access the capital markets, companies need access to this data. If the SEC raises the threshold to $3.5 billion, companies will not know who is holding as well as buying their shares or the shares of similar companies and thus hinder their ability to continue to compete for and raise capital. Additionally, the proposed changes will expose more U.S. public companies to hedge fund activism. According to IHS Market, 86 percent of activist investors would no longer have to make 13F filings.4 This result directly contradicts recent calls by the SEC for greater transparency amidst the market uncertainty and volatility caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic. Many activist investors have taken advantage of sh are price declines to amass larger stakes in potential targets. Under the proposed reporting 2 See Gregory A. Lang, President & CEO Chair, NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. and Sharon Dowdall, Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee, NOVAGOLD Resources Inc., Letter to SEC (Sept. 2, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7 -08-20/s70820 -7753767 -223206.pdf . 3 IHS Markit, ""SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis"" (Aug. 7, 2020), available at https://ihsmarkit.com/research -analysis/secs -13f-proposal --issuer -and-investor -analysis.html . 4 See id.

PAGE 4 National Mining Association 101 Constitution Avenue, NW | Suite 500 East | Washington, DC 20001 | (202) 463 -2600 threshold, companies would no longer be able to monitor those activist investors. The loss of this information could potentially expose companies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers resulting in negative economic and financial consequences for companies and the communities in which they operate. Instead of eliminating the reporting of this important information, the SEC should b e expanding reporting to include short positions. Conclusion The SEC’s proposal contradicts its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. If finalized, the increase in the reporting threshold would seriously jeopardize the robust engagement by U.S. companies with their investors. The proposal will also negatively impact a company’s ability to attract new long -term investors and detect potent ial activists with serious economic consequences. These negative impacts far outweigh the modest cost savings in paperwork burdens for investment managers. Rather than eliminating the transparency the 13(f) program provides , NMA urges the SEC to withdraw the proposed rule and pursue other reforms that would promote more timely and complete disclosure through monthly reporting, requir e the public disclosure of short positions, and reduc e the archaic 45 -day reporting period .

All rights reserved | GLEIF unrestricted Page 1 of 2 Response of the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the Proposed Rule for Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers September 2020 The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) is pleased to provide comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) on the Proposed Rule for Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers. GLEIF will focus its comments on the use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the consultation. First, GLEIF would like to respond to the Question 21. “Should we require managers to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F?” Today, U.S. agencies and regulators use more than 50 various identifiers to track entities, of which the Central Registration Depository (CRD) and the Central Index Key (CIK) are 2 examples, both of which are open identifiers. The OPEN Government Data Act requires, among other items, that government agency data be open and shared with the public. As data becomes more open, the challenge of interoperability among agencies increasingly will become significant. Therefore, continuing to promote and require partitioned, albeit open identifiers, that provide isolated use cases is not sustainable in the long term. The LEI can harmonize disparate government data sets while co-existing with the current identifier schemes that are fit for purpose within individual agencies and regulators. GLEIF would also like to highlight that consistent use of the LEI within and across Federal agencies is crucial for ensuring reporting consistency and requirements for reporting entities. In a previous Consultation released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the CFTC stated that the National Futures Association (NFA) Form Pool Quarterly Reports (PQR) may be revised to include questions regarding the LEI. GLEIF would like to bring into the attention of Commission an example Form 13F report recently submitted by a reporting entity. Mandating the LEI for the reporting entity would make several data fields (e.g., company conformed name, state of incorporation, business address, mail address) unnecessary to report on the form. The SEC would benefit from the additional data contained in an LEI record, most notably the legal name, legal address, headquarter address, legal form and immediate and ultimate parent, among other information. Lastly, GLEIF will be willing to work with the SEC in mapping existing identifier schemes, like the CIK to the LEI, if only for internal purposes initially. GLEIF also suggests the SEC reviewing our API. The GLEIF API gives developers access to the full LEI Data search engine functionality, including filters, full-text and single-field searches of legal entity and ownership data, and “fuzzy” matching of relevant data fields such as names and addresses. In addition to LEI reference data, the GLEIF API also makes available further related data, e. g. reference data of LEI issuers, code lists used in LEI records and mapped identifiers like BIC or ISIN codes. © 2020 GLEIF and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved | GLEIF unrestricted Page 2 of 2 GLEIF would also provide its comments for the Question 23. “Would this additional identifying on Form 13F be useful information? If so, how?”. GLEIF believes that the growth of the LEI as a primary identifier continues to increase among financial institutions primarily through data vendors that provide financial content to these institutions. Similarly, Form 13F’s, among other SEC filings, often are processed by data vendors and information subsequently is fed to financial institutions that are following Form 13F quarterly disclosures. By including the LEI in the 13F, data vendors can more easily automate Form 13F processes and financial institutions will receive content quicker and more efficiently. GLEIF would also like to respond to the Question 24 “Would disclosing this information be unduly burdensome for 13F filers?” GLEIF does not think that disclosing the LEI would be unduly burdensome for 13F filers given investment advisors and asset managers are likely already to have an LEI due to existing regulations requiring the LEI in the U.S., most notably Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Allen 942 South Shady Grove Road Executive Vice President Memphis, TN 38120 General Counsel and Secretary Member of the Executive Committee VIA E-MAIL ( rule-comments@sec.gov ) September 28, 2020 Securities and Exchange Commission Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers On July 10, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) issued a request for public comment soliciting input on proposed rules increasing the Form 13F reporting threshold under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Proposing Release”). FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the Commission’s request. FedEx is a global company that provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. Our annual revenues total approximately $71 billion, we have more than 500,000 team members, and we serve customers in more than 220 countries and territories. Our common stock, of which over 260 million shares are outstanding, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We present our views from the perspective of a preparer of disclosures required to be filed with the Commission and as a large accelerated filer registered with the Commission. We commend the Commission for its recent efforts to review existing rules and regulations and consider updates when appropriate in light of the evolution of U.S. public markets. However, we urge the Commission to table the Proposing Release until there is an alternative source of information regarding the identities of stockholders of public companies that is currently available under the existing Form 13F reporting requirements. Specifically, we are concerned that raising the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion would reduce market transparency and impair our ability to engage with stockholders. For the period ended June 30, 2020, 1,340 firms reported ownership of FedEx stock on Form 13F reports. We estimate that the proposed threshold increase to $3.5 billion would exempt approximately 1,000 of these firms—representing 75% of our Form 13F reporting stockholders—from the Form 13F reporting requirements, greatly reducing visibility into our stockholder base. We believe the Proposing Release contrasts with the recent approach taken by the Commission to ask issuers for increased transparency through disclosure. We are particularly concerned that the resulting reduction in transparency from the proposed changes to Section 13(f) would impair Securities and Exchange Commission September 28, 2020 Page Two our ability to identify our most active stockholders and engage effectively with them. In the last year, we have engaged with a global and diverse group of over 150 stockholders, including actively managed funds, index funds, union and public funds, and socially responsible investment funds. The loss of information provided on Form 13F reports would significantly hinder FedEx’s efforts to engage with stockholders at a time when there is consensus among stockholders, companies and policymakers about the critical importance of stockholder engagement. Further, we use Form 13F reports to monitor and assess potential activist investors whose interests are inconsistent with our long-term business strategy and the investment strategy of our long-term investors. The proposed changes to Section 13(f) would deter a company’s ability to detect a potential activist and expose the company and its stockholders to heightened risk of an activist attack. Like many other issuers and interested parties that have submitted comments on the Proposing Release, we believe it is important to pursue modernization of the Section 13(f) reporting system through rules that increase transparency and promote timely and complete disclosure and a process that thoughtfully considers potential consequences for institutional investors as well as other potentially affected market participants, including issuers. FedEx believes this approach would be consistent with the Commission’s undertaking to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. We note that we are also signatories to comment letters on the Proposing Release submitted by the New York Stock Exchange and the National Investor Relations Institute. We appreciate your consideration of our comments. If you would like more information, please feel free to contact me at your convenience. Sincerely yours, FedEx Corporation Mark R.

I've had countless tasks put before me in my long career that revolve around joining instruments/positions with their security identifiers.These have included both for data modelling internally and reporting externally as have had my colleagues.In my line its called maintaining a ""security master"", an non trivial exercise. Prior to FIGI and Bloomberg's initiative to make them a universal identifier,an open and accessible solution to lookup, match and translate between other MIC's including CUSIP an solution did not exist.Freely available to all operations, developers, service providers and stakeholders in this process we know have that solution. By adopting FIGI's the actual implementers -- be they technical or non-technical -- of these reports haveboth an easy to use website and a scalable webservice to search and match holdings and ensure accurate reporting.FIGI's universe exceeds CUSIP and as such you can ensure that a FIGI is accurately matched to the correct non-fungible instrument.

(“C boe ”)(Cboe : CBOE) appreciate s the opportunity to provide feedback on the P roposal . Cboe understands that the overarching objectives of the Proposal are to update the reporting threshold to proportionally reflect the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million represented in 1975 and to reduce the cost burden for smaller managers who are subject to 13F reporting . With those objective s in mind, Cboe ’s comments are focused on the perspective of a public company that utilizes 13F reporting. Cboe’s stock is listed on Cb oe’s BZX Equities Exchange and is also available for trading on NYSE and Nasdaq . Cboe is one of the world’s largest exchange holding companies and its subsidiaries operate four U.S. options exchanges (Cboe Options, C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options); a futures exchange (CFE); four U.S. stock exchanges (BYX Equities, BZX Equities, EDGA Equities, and EDGX Equities); one of the largest pan -European stock exchanges (Cboe Europe Equities); and , a foreign exchange -trading platform (Cboe FX) . Summary 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8 9290 (July 8 , 2020 ), 85 FR 46016 (July 31, 2020). September 28, 2020 Page 2 of 5 400 South LaSalle Street › Chicago, IL 60605 › cboe.com • The Proposal greatly reduces financial market transparency for companies and investors. Cboe urges the Commission to craft the final rule in a way that does not hinder the financial decisions of investors and companies who currently rely on 13F information. • In addition to reducing essential visibility into financial markets , the Proposal fails to address the crucial issues currently existing in the 13F reporting syste m. • Finally, the Proposal obstructs public companies ’ ability to obtain meaningful and timely information for shareholder engagement . Cboe ’s Concerns and Recommendations a. The proposed a mendments to 13F reporting negatively impact investors and companies by reducing transparency needed to make informed financial decisions, oversee company stock, and assist smaller asset managers and retail investors. 13F reporting guidelines were adopted in 1975 to enhance investor confidence in securities markets by mandating certain disclosures from institutional investors2. Over the past 45 years, the information acquired from 13F reports ha s served as an invaluabl e source for investors and public companies who utilize the data to make informed financial decisions. The Proposal, which seeks to increase the 13F reporting threshold 35 times from $100 million to $3.5 billion, would severely limit available information. Cboe believes the Proposal would hinder both investors ’ and public companies’ access to the critical information they have consistently relied on to identify key shareholders and track changes in stock ownership. Increased transparency of financial mark ets is beneficial not only to companies whose stock is being reported through the 13F reporting system , but also to the investing public. Publicly available 13F reports increase transparency and contribute to the public having a deeper sense of trust in th e financial markets. Without this publicly available information, there will be less transparency into financial markets which can lead to reduced investor confidence. Additionally, information generated in 13F reports is widely used by researchers and academic s whom provide a benefit to the investing public. As a result, greatly reducing the scope of this valuable publicly available information would negatively impact a wide range of financial market participants. The amount of available information eliminated by the Proposal is significant . By raising the reporting threshold to the proposed level, the vast majority of currently reporting investment managers will be exempted from the 13F filing requirements and their represented assets will go unreported. This drastic reduction in transparency affects public companies that rely on th is publicly available information. Specifically, the number of filing investment managers Cboe follows would fall from 505 t o 276, based on data from the second quarter of 2020. 2 Pub. L. No. 94 -29, 89 Stat. 97 (1975). September 28, 2020 Page 3 of 5 400 South LaSalle Street › Chicago, IL 60605 › cboe.com The proposed loss of transparency will make it harder for public companies, of all sizes , to accurately oversee the ownership of their stock. With less 13F reporting information available, it will be more difficult for companies to monitor hedge fund positions and increasingly easier for activists to secretly acquire large positions in company stock. Such activists present specific dangers to a public company’s long -term strategies and investor goals. This result is particularly troubling. It is important to note that large public companies are not the only market participants that will be negatively impacted by the lack of transparency associ ated with the Proposal. Retail investors and small asset managers utilize publicly available 13F data to make important investment decisions. Many of these smaller participants are unable to afford the exorbitant costs associated with stock surveillance, a nd without the publicly available information provided by 13F reports, retail investors and small asset managers will lose visibility into large portions of the financial markets. Without this information, their ability to make accurate and complete invest ment decisions will be hindered. As a result, Cboe urges the Commission to withdraw the Proposal and instead issue a new proposal that does not reduce publicly available information and hinder the ability of public companies and investors to make informed decisions as discussed in more detail below . b. The Proposal create s further challenges for investors and companies and mov es in the opposite direction of the SEC’s goal to improve transparency in public markets and protect investors. The 13F reporting system should instead be withdrawn and a new proposal should be issued to address the lengthy, infrequent reporting timeline and the incomplete disclosure requirements. The proposed, lower reporting threshold in the Proposal not only moves in the opposite direction of the SEC’s goals, but also no longer addresses the original intent Congress had when first adopting Section 13(F) in 1975. As previous ly mentioned , the int ent was to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the [the U.S.] securities markets.”3 With less overall transparency into stock ownership and a reduction in company engagement with shareholders, the Proposal is unlikely to improve in vestor confidence. As such, Cboe recommends that the Commission withdraw its proposed amendments to the 13F reporting system and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions previously submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Gro up, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.4 Specifically, Cboe believes that the current 13F reporting system should be 3 Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S.

To be sure, s hortening the delay period to 2 days, and mandating monthly disclosures, would meaningfully reform 13F reporting. Additionally, the lack of requirements mandating investment managers to disclose their short derivative s positions forms incomplete informatio n and needs to be addressed. Cboe recommends that the final version of any amendment to the 13F reporting system should significantly reduce the delay period and require short derivatives positions to be disclosed while also keeping the 13F reporting thres hold at $100 million. c. In addition, t he Proposal dramatically reduces the amount of meaningful engagement between public companies and their shareholders. For years, 13F data has allowed companies to engage with their shareholders and institutional investors in a manner that is both efficient and meaningful. Shareholder engagement is a limited resource public companies must prioritize as executives and senio r management only have a finite amount of available time. As a result, it is important for well -functioning companies to allocate time to speak with their largest investors, fund managers notably engaged in activism, and small er shareholders who are interested in increasing their company holdings. Without the crucial information provided by 13F reports, public companies will be forced to a pportion shareholder time at an ad hoc basis and speculate as to who owns their shares . With institutional investor own ership consistently rising, shareholders ’ desire to engage in corporate governance has made the information provided by 13F filings increasingly important for companies. Commonly, companies are relying on shareholder consultations when making decisions . This important line of communication is impossible without the ability for companies to identify key shareholders . Consequently, t he Proposal greatly reduces the ability for a company to efficiently and effectively engage its shareholders in a meaningful way. Therefore, Cboe cannot support the Proposal and recommends that the Commission withdraw it and instead issue a new proposal to amend the 13F reporting system that preserves transparency and allows public companies of all sizes to continue their valuable engagement with shareholders. ***** Cboe appreciates the opportunity to share its views on the Proposal. Cboe believes that the Proposal greatly reduces important transparency for companies and investors as well as the amount of meaningful engagement that public companies can have with key shareholders . In addition to these concerns , the Proposal also fails to ad dress the crucial issues currently existing in the 13F reporting system. As a result, Cboe recommends that the Commission withdraw the Proposal and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the previously submitted rulemaking petitions on this topic , includi ng reducing the reporting delay period from 45 days , requiring short derivatives positions to be disclosed , and No. 4 -691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf .

Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F. Street, NE Washington, D.C. 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers ( File No. S7 -08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: The Independent Community Bankers of America (“ICBA”) 1 appreciates this opportunity to respond to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposal to raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion from $100 million for Form 13F reports filed by institutional investment managers . Adopted in 1975 as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“E xchange Act”) requires a manager to file a report with the SEC if the manager exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding certain equity securities (“13(f) securities”)2 having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day of any month of any calendar year of at least $100 million. SEC Rule 13f -1 requires that managers file quarterly reports on Form 13F if the accounts over which they exercise investment discretion hold an aggregate of more than $100 million in 13(f) securities . The information reported on Form 13F becomes publicly available upon filing, unless the manager has filed an application for confidential treatment with the SEC. ICBA ’s Position ICBA opposes raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F reporting from its present level of $100 million. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of 1 The Independent Community Bankers of America® creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. With more than 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute 99 percent of all banks, employ nearly 750,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties. Holding more than $5 trillion in assets, nearly $4 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.4 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the a gricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their customers’ dreams in communities throughout America. ICBA is dedicated exclusiv ely to representing the interests of the community banking industry and its membership through effective advocacy, best -in-class education, and high -quality products and services. 2 Rule 13f -1(c) under the Exchange Act defines “section 13(f) securities” t o mean equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of the Securities and Exchange Act that are admitted to trading on a national securities exchange or quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association. 2 current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency for many small and mid -size publicly held companies. Consequently, many of ICBA’s publicly held members would be adversely impacted if the proposal w as to become effective. Section 13(f) was added to the Exchange Act following a study the SEC conducted at Congress’s direction which concluded that there were certain “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors.” The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities m arkets. Particularly for small and mid -sized publicly held companies, w e believe that the goals of the section 13(f) disclosure program will be thwarted if the rule is adopted , leaving significant gaps in information concerning the holdings and activities of institutional investors . The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to many of these issuers since it is the only data that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling shares each quarter. This inform ation cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms which often rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts . Small and mid- sized publicly held community banks are particularly concerned about their ability to identify their active shareholders and engage with them effectively. As one of our large r community banks indicated: Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say “ yes” to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increas ing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. The SEC says that one of the chief reasons it is proposing such a large increase in the threshold is because it wo uld reduce the regulatory burden on small institutional managers. Currently, there are 5,089 managers that exceed the $100 million threshold, which is 17 times the number when the program was started in 1975. However, the SEC acknowledges that the direct compliance costs associated with preparing filings on Form 13F have decreased since 1975, principally due to lower -cost information processing systems . As those information systems become less expensive, the cost of complying with this rule will continue to shrink. While ICBA agrees that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe t hat the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on the ability of small and mid -size publicly held companies to engage effectively with their shareholders, a ttract new long -term investors, and 3 detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. Publicly held community banks will be at a distinct disadvantage with regard to their most active shareholders if they are unable to identify them on a regular basis. Conclusion ICBA opposes raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F reporting from its present level of $100 million because it will impair the ability of many publicly held community banks to identify their most active shareholders and engage with them. ICBA appreciates the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

Agnieszka Baier,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7843327-223831.htm,,"September 25, 2020 As an active retail trader and a business owner, I find current requirements for institutional traders with account values over $100M to report their holdings on a quarterly basis invaluable to my investment decision making. Forms 13F have been consistently included in my research and decision-making process. The SEC's proposal to change this rule in an effort to lessen administrative burden on smaller managers would be a mistake. Fund managers holding between $100M and $3.5B in assets under management are not ""small"" as the SEC call them. I am a small trader and a small business manager. These funds have plentiful resources to prepare such forms. And preparing them is just the cost of doing business. If every American has to pay taxes or be ""burdened"" to file his or her tax return, then fund managers in charge of $100M and more certainly should be required to report their holdings. This is not about administrative burden or costs. It is more about accountability and transparency. I believe there should be more transparency - not less. Traders and investors from all over the world want to participate in our financial markets because of the transparency and plentiful information about public companies or funds available to them for research via the SEC. Please keep it that way."

As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts – as it is the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around holdings, significantly undermining issuer -investor engagement particularly for small and mid -cap companies such as ours. There are currently 35 institutions that file 13F forms for INTT. Under the proposed rule change, nearly a quarter of these firms (23 percent or 8 institutions) would no longer be required to file. The 35 curre nt filers own a combined 5.2 million shares or 50 percent of the outstanding. This would decline to 3.3 million shares or 32 percent of the outstanding under the proposed rule change. We believe that this proposal would seriously jeopardize our sharehol der engagement efforts by excluding more than 5,000 investment managers – or nearly 90% of all filers – from disclosure. The long - term impact on the public markets could be detrimental to the U.S., as this proposal will deter private companies from going p ublic, or prompt them to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency around reporting disclosures. We ask that the Commission steps back to reconsider the implications of this proposed rule, and instead refocus its efforts on the moderniz ation of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency.

Kennedy Pkwy First Floor West Short Hills NJ 07078 am@BrilLiquid.com September 24, 2020 Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1020 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers; File Number S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman, On behalf of BrilLiquid, a capital markets advisory boutique, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on propos ed amendments to the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers (the “Proposal”). I applaud the Commission’s initiative to use its authority to modernize the data disclosures made by investment managers under section 13(f) disclosure program. Undoubtedly reform is long overdue. The Proposal to raise the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion can be significantly improved to better align regulat ory and public policy objectives with the needs of market participants . Determining an appropriate reporting threshold is just one aspect of the regulation that requires careful consideration. There is sound logic to raising threshold amounts to reflect inflation when considering issues relat ed to investor protection (for example, in the definition of “accredited investor,” “qualified purchaser,” and “qualified institutional buyer”). As the Proposal observes, $100 million is not what it used to be! One of the consequences of the failure to rai se the threshold for various such exemptions as market values have appreciated has been a broad shift in financial assets and financing to private markets and away from public markets. Securities market information is a public good, helping to ensure the i ntegrity of markets and provide participants confidence that markets are fair. Any e rosion in the quality of financial information or the capital markets does not serve the U.S. well and hinders the foundational role of U.S. capital markets at the center o f global capital markets. Advances in technology and computers and the creation of the Internet have significantly reduced the cost to investment managers in making regulatory disclosures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report the cost of personal computers and peripheral equipment in the U.S. has declined to approximately 3% of the level in 1997 when the agency began keeping records (equivalent to a factor of almost 30 times). There is a strong case to lower the reporting thre shold and to modernize the 13(f) disclosure program more extensively and consider (1) which institutions should be required to make disclosures, (2) the Official List of 13(f) securities, (3) the timing of 13(f) disclosures, and (4) the treatment of “short ” positions. Who Should File 13Fs? There are currently around 5,401 13F filers, a minority of the investment managers registered with the Commission or state regulators in the U.S. There are 18,222 investment managers registered with the Commission and an additional 20,847 exempt reporting advisers that are not currently required to make 13(f) disclosures. As the Commission seeks to facilitate access to Main Street retail investors by private investment managers and private companies, including exempt repor ting advisers venture capital and private equity advisors in the 13(f) disclosure program will strengthen investor protections. 2 For the quarter ending March 2020, the number of corporate equity positions held by large 13F filers (great er than $3.5 billion ) was 922,333 compared to 600,802 for smaller filers. Of the approximately 5,401 13F filers during the quarter ending December 2019, 896 managers filed consolidated disclosures for one or more other investment managers. In total, the filings covered 2,695 other managers. The utility of consolidated reports is questionable when investment decision -making is undertaken by another manager, even if there is shared voting authority. The 13(f) disclosures by certain types of investment managers (for example, bank holding companies and broker -dealers) may be of little utility to most market participants. A careful examination of the eligibility criteria to file consolidated reports may improve the utility of Form 13F filings and reduce the burden of processing and interpreting data from 13(f) disclosures. What Should be on the Official List of Section 13(f) Securities ? The Official List should be updated to recognize the blurring of the lines between exchange -listed and private market securities. A significant number of non -13F filers appear to make Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G filings. Requiring managers to make Form 13F filings for holdings reported on Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G will improve market transparency. Registered investment companies that invest in private or restricted securities are required to report holdings on Form N -PORT. However, N -PORT filings are not as accessible nor as timely as Form 13F disclosures. Requiring hol ders of securities issued by private companies with a specific size or value, or with a threshold number of holders, to file Form 13F would help ensure a level playing field for retail investors a nd other market participants and enhanc e market transparency and integrity . Many public equity market participants, including Main Street retail investors, are at an information disadvantage compared to investors with access to private capital markets. Increased capital market financing under v arious exemptions from registration has resulted in corporate securities representing a shrinking portion of the investment universe as reflected by the Official List. Derivatives and exchange - traded funds and products have filled the void in public capita l formation. Whil e the Official List includes certain convertible securities issued , including those issued under Rule 144A , nonconvertible debt and equity securities of registered companies and sizeable private companies should be added . Many companies pa y to list their bonds on the NYSE and Nasdaq in addition to the ongoing listing fees for shares of common stock and preferred securities . Currently, the stock exchanges do not publicly disclose price or ownership information about such bonds. With popular bond ETFs publishing holdings and prices of underlying securities daily, there is little reason to exclude corporate bonds from the Official List. The high yield bond market which has emerged as a major source of capital for many registered companies received a further boost since the Global Financial Crisis with widespread trading of credit derivatives . While such securities are not convertible into shares of common stock, holders often engage in hedging activities in the public equity markets when the shares of the issuer are listed . Some Form 13F filers voluntarily include securities that are not on the Official List. For example, three managers report holdings of U.S. Treasury s ecurities. Others include mutual funds and some over -the- count (OTC) market securities, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, in their Form 13F filings. As many U.S. investment managers have expanded their activities overseas, U.S. investors would also be well -served if the Official List included holdings of securities of non -U.S. companies. When Should Positions Be Reported? Given advances in technology and computing t hat facilitate real-time trade reporting, there is no logistical reason to delay Form 13F filings significantly beyond the end of the reporting period. The Commission noted its own use of technology to capture data with respect to market activity and the use of more sophisticated systems for following daily transactions for purposes of market surve illance. Of all the Dec 2019 13F Filers, the average and median days between the end of the quarter and date of submission were both relatively unchanged with the average at 42 days for Q1 and 41 days for Q2 and the median at 37 days for Q1 and 36 days for Q2. 3 The steadily increasing popularity of index -based investing has resulted in a small number of asset managers own ing large stakes in many public companies. However, contrary to traditional concepts of control through the exercise of active ownership, m ost of these investors are passive, with investment decisions being limited almost entirely to the choice of a benchmark index. Only recently have the beneficial asset owners begun to pressure such index managers to adopt more substantive shareholder votin g policies. Some asset owners are reevaluating the use of traditional equity market indexes and various index construction methodologies given divergent investment performance and implicit environmental, social, and governance (ESG) choices embedded in eac h index. Additionally, with the widespread use of differential shareholder voting rights, together with other structural features, the exercise of “control” by 5% shareholders is often considerably less than presumed. Equity market structure changes in rec ent decades, particularly since the bursting of the Internet Bubble, have conspired to make going public less attractive, especially for small and mid -cap companies. Consequently, investment holdings and trading volumes have become concentrated in the larg est market capitalization companies. Declining transparency in trading of securities in public markets as a result of anonymous electronic order flow has contributed to the shift away from registered public offerings, often subject to significant front -running. More issuers are conducting confidentially -marketed private offerings of registered equity securities that are less accessible by many smaller institutional investment managers and Main Street retail i nvestors. Although not considered in the Proposal, increasing the frequency of reporting possibly in combination with potentially lowering the reporting threshold to, for example, $50 million may help to restore the ecosystem of small and mid -cap focused i nvestment managers, critical to the success of many small and mid-cap companies. While some suggest front -running and copycatting are problems for smaller investment managers, a larger problem is the lack of factual information available to market particip ants. With the decline in trading commission funded broker -dealer research services, investment managers often now incur at least some cost in communicating their investment thesis to other market participants directly. Many investment managers have taken to social media and investment focused Internet platforms, newsletters, and podcasts to actively publish and promote ideas and talk their book. Increasing the frequency of 13F filings will increase the integrity and confidence of market participants by all owing critical scrutiny of actual holdings. Front -running and copycatting may be a legitimate concern for investment managers taking large stakes in companies relative to the prevailing liquidity. There is ample evidence of front -running anticipated and announced changes to major equity indexes because of the way index funds rebalance their portfolios. However, across the market capitalization spectrum of companies, active investors taking large stakes in the secondary market are quite rare and they are able to avail themselves of the 13F CTR if desired. What About Short Positions? There are pros and cons when it comes to reporting of short positions and equivalents by investment managers. Currently, investment managers must report long positions in exchange -traded put option s in 13F securities but not short positions. As such, the utility of the long position data reported on Form 13F is questionable when an investment manager also has an unreported short position. Naïve market participants, includin g Main Street retail investors and financial media, may draw inappropriate conclusions from the reported data. Requiring investment manager to report the aggregate value of short positions held as the reporting date in the summary table may be an acceptabl e way to alleviate this information gap . Recommendation So, monthly reporting on Form 13F by the 15th of each month seems like a reasonable compromise for initial reform . Today it is customary for beneficial owners to receive monthly statements from many broker -dealers in spite of past industry protests of a switch in delivery of statements from a quarterly basis to monthly. To make 13F filings more widely accessible to i nvestors, media, and other ecosystem participants, providing commonly -used identifiers in the Form 13F such as stock exchange symbol in 4 addition to the CUSIP and other security identifiers would be useful. Expanding the number of investment managers and th e universe of corporate securities will increase transparency and integrity of capital markets. For ease of reference, the numbered requests for comments in the Proposal are repeated in bold -face below.1 Given the prospect of losing so much valuable data, I have endeavored to incorporate Form 13F data that is publicly available on the EDGAR site in support of my comments and recommendations. 1. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f -1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13f -1? Is the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion appropriate? If another threshold would be more appropriate, what should the threshold be and why? The Commission should not adopt an amendment to r ule 13f -1 as proposed but instead should lower the reporting threshold to $50 million from $100 million. The Proposal fails to consider advances in technology and the lower cost of computing that more than offset the market value increases in U.S. securiti es. While the Commission is not an active user of the data in Form 13F filings, there is widespread use at public companies and the general public. While it is difficult to identify specific uses of Form 13F filings by the general public, interest appears to be at an all -time high. Figure 1.1 illustrates a rising interest in Form 13F filings as measured by Google search for the term 13F. The jump in search activity in 2020 is coincident with the adoption of zero -commission trading at many discount brokerage firms. The emergence of consumer -friendly trading platforms, such as Robinhood, have glamorized investing and trading in a way not seen in more than a decade and have succeeded in entic ing a new generation of retail investors into the public and private markets. Retail interest in Form 13F filings as reflected by Google searches is at all -time highs. As can be seen from Figure 1.2, peak interest in the Form 13F filing deadline month is significantly higher than for no n-filing months. Increasing the frequency of Form 13F filings will allow for information to be incorporated into market prices more efficiently. Amending the Form 13F to broaden security coverage beyond exchange -listed securities and lowering the threshold will allow for greater scrutiny of transactions and investment managers . 1 This document is for discussion purposes only and does not constitute advice of any kind, including tax, accounting, legal or regulatory advice, and BrilLiquid LLC is not and does not hold itself out to be an advisor as to tax, accounting, legal or regulat ory matters.

Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(f) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? If so, how? And if so, is there a different threshold that would be more appropriate? Are there any additional effects of raising the Form 13F reporting threshold that we have not considered? The Proposal to raise the thresho ld for Form 13F filing obligations will drastically reduce the utility of Form 13F filings for the majority of listed companies, all of whom use information in the organization of their investor relations activities. Main Street retail investors may seek a ffirmation of the wisdom of their investment by checking the number and type of institutional investors that also own the security. The nature and size of large 6 investors have changed dramatically since 1975. Consider the five “super -size” investors compri sed of the largest ETF managers (BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) and the largest black -box quantitative managers (Renaissance Technologies and Dimensional Fund Advisors). None of the super -size investors were as systemically -important to equity mark et structure in 1975 as they are today. Somewhat counterintuitively, the importance of smaller investment managers across the entire spectrum of listed companies is highlighted when one adjusts for the holdings of super -size investors. Public policy should include consideration of the market impact of changes in (global) index methodology of the major equity and bond index providers and trading strategy implementation at the super -size and other large investors. Some of the world’s largest investment managers are shifting passively -managed assets to benchmark indices that are considered better fit for purpose than legacy equity indexes. Oftentimes, the data vendor creating the new benchmark is also responsible for l egacy indexes. In order to protect retail investors in particular, consideration should be given to identifying positions in Form 13F that are indexed, along with an index identifier, versus those over which the manager controls the investment decision. Figure 2.1 illustrates the holdings of some of the largest index fund managers and black -box quantitative funds. The market impact associated with changes to major equity indexes is well -known. Small and mid - capitalization companies often have higher concent rations of holdings from the super -size investors. Retail investors may draw false comfort from the presence of institutional investors that do not consider company fundamentals.

Should we, as proposed, adop t an amendment to rule 13f -1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis fo r this calculation? The proposed amendment should not be adopted. 4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively reflect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? For example, under this approach, we could take the market s ize as of the end of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, average those values, and compare that average to the size of the U.S. equities market in 1975. If so, why? Is such a five-year period (or other period) more appropriate for calculating an average grow th rate to apply over the 45 years since the threshold was initially set? The various elements for form 13F reporting should be examined in light of their contribution to transparency and the integrity of capital markets. For example, it is desirable to in crease the number of 9 Form 13F filers per company above a threshold level to foster confidence in the liquidity of the shares of common stock. The composition of the shareholder base, for example the number of large versus smaller investment managers, may b e important if smaller managers are significantly more active than larger investment managers. 5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis for this calculation? If so, how should we measure stock market returns? For example, would dividends be included or excluded? Is there another measure that we should use as a basis for initially adjusting the reporting threshold? See above. 6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F to account for consumer price inflation? If so, what measure of consumer price inflation —PCE or CPI — should we use? Is there another measure of consumer price inflation (or other inflation measure) that we should use? If so, what? Adjusting the reporting thres hold is one aspect of the 13(f) disclosure program along with who files, frequency and timing of filings, and securities covered. The current reporting threshold of $100 million has not been a burden for filers. Reducing the reporting threshold to $50 mill ion will better reflect the benefits of advances in the productivity of computing technology outpacing stock market returns since 1975. Figure 6.1 CPI for All Urban Consumers —Personal computers and peripheral equipment in U.S. city average, all urban con sumers, not seasonally adjuste d Note. Index = 100 in 2007. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics 10 7. Should we adopt a different rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3.6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a different rounding convention, why? No rounding is necessary. 8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdens ome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? There is little evidence that Form 13F filing obligations to managers of any size. Figure 8.1 shows s maller managers tend to hold significantly fewer positions than larger firms. At the 75th percentile, smaller managers hold only 171 positions. Reporting positions on Form 13F is not a burden in 2020. Figure 8.1 Number of Positions Reported on Form 13F, Quarter ending March 31, 2020 Small Managers Large Managers Super -Size Mean 179 1,860 7,293 25% 28 113 3,394 50% (Median) 75 494 3,579 75% 171 1,591 7,478 Note. Many large investment managers report positions for other managers and consequently ma ny of the positions reported are for the same underlying security. 11 Based upon Form 13F filings in Q1 2020, smaller managers met their filing obligations in 36 days compared to almost 40 days for larger managers suggesting no additional burden on smaller managers compared to larger managers. Figure 8. 2 Form 13F Days -to-Filing of Filers in Q1 2020 vs. Q2 2020 9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? As the Proposal notes, there are a plethora of uses for the Form 13F data by market participants. However, a significant user for each U.S. exchange -listed company is the company itself. The Proposal overlooks this category of users. Each company listed on the NY SE or Nasdaq incurs costs to maintain an exchange listing and registration with the Commission. Initial and ongoing listing fees for companies are determined based upon shares outstanding, not by market capitalization or trading volume. The majority of lis ted companies are effectively subsidizing payment for order flow by primary listing exchanges, not in the markets for their shares, but in the largest and most actively traded companies. Form 13F filings provide small and mid -cap companies the opportunity to target investor relations activities and support capital formation. Companies often use Form 13F filings to allocate management resources to investor relations activities. Investor relations strategies vary from company to company. Often larger investor s have an advantage over small investment managers when it comes to securing access to company management. Contrary to the stated intention of reducing the burden on smaller investment managers, eliminating the Form 13F filings of smaller managers risks ca sting them to oblivion. Out of sight, small investment managers will be out of the mind of company managers and potentially asset owners. Smaller investment managers represent a larger proportion of the institutional shareholder base at many small and mid -cap companies than at the largest market -capitalization companies. In focusing on the 12 overall equity market ownership, the Proposal fails to adequately consider the capital formation needs of the majority of listed companies. Smaller investment managers may be less likely to mirror holdings of benchmark indexes, both in terms of company selection and in position -sizing, than larger investmen t managers. Smaller managers also make up a much large r number of total managers. As such , to the extent their actions are independent of other investment managers, their contribution to the quality of markets they participate in may be significant. Chairman Clayton highlighted the importance of the public markets in their own right and to ensu re the integrity of private markets in a 2019 speech at The Economic Club of New York. “Main Street investors can be confident that public company stock prices reflect the views of professional investors. This is the rare kind of ""free -riding"" that econom ists adore and that underpins Burton Malkiel's Random Walk Down Wall Street and the rise of passive investing. On the other hand, from the perspective of firms, managers making long -term decisions —such as whether to invest in human capital, equipment, and research —rely substantially on metrics that are themselves dependent on today’s public market - generated pricing information. These include EBITDA multiples and cost of capital estimates that, somewhat ironically, are essential to the efficient functioning of our private markets.” 13 Figure 9.1 Number of Large vs. Small 13F Filers by Most Widely -Held 1,000 Listed Stocks, March 31, 2020 Note . Companies ranked by number of Form 13F filer owners, declining left to right. 10. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to larger managers? If so, how? Is it beneficial to the markets to continue to have access to Form 13F data from larger managers? If so, why? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? The Form 13F filing obligations d o not appear unduly burdensome to most larger investment managers. Many large firms, including the very largest exchange -traded funds (ETFs), publish daily fund holdings and prices of underlying securities. For managers making filings on behalf of other in vestment managers, there is probably some additional complexity compared to managers not making consolidated filings. Form 13F filings for bank holding companies, broker -dealers, and proprietary trading market -making firms often include large numbers of positions in derivatives and underlying securities. The utility of such consolidated filings and those of market -making firms is questionable because of the high turnover and activity in securities not included in the current version Official List. 14 Larger in vestment managers may find the filing obligations of Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G more of a compliance burden. The 5% threshold for filing is binding more frequently at large investment managers. Table 10.1. shows there were 8,825 Schedule 13D and 13G fil ings during the quarter ending March 31, 2020. Of these, 836 (9.5%) of the filings were by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. In aggregate, the top 40 filers made 2,211 (25%) of the total number of filings during the quarter. Table 10.1 Number of Schedule 13D and 13G Filings by Top 40 Filers , Quarter Ending March 31 , 2020 Filer Number BlackRock Inc. 391 STATE STREET CORP 250 VANGUARD GROUP INC 195 RENAISSANCE TECHNOLOGIES LLC 105 FMR LLC 98 WELLINGTON MANAGEMENT GROUP LLP 79 PRICE T ROWE ASSOCIATES INC /MD/ 79 WELLS FARGO & COMPANY/MN 75 DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP 61 MORGAN STANLEY 40 Invesco Ltd. 39 ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN L.P. 39 Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. 34 Capital World Investors 33 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO 29 Hudson Bay Capital Management LP 28 FIRST TRUST PORTFOLIOS LP 28 Capital International Investors 28 UBS OCONNOR LLC 26 iSHARES TRUST 26 ARMISTICE CAPITAL, LLC 26 Magnetar Financial LLC 24 BARROW HANLEY MEWHINNEY & STRAUSS LLC 23 SABBY MANAGEMENT, LLC 22 PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. 22 LSV ASSET MANAGEMENT 22 WASATCH ADVISORS INC 21 DONALD SMITH & CO., INC. 21 Capital Research Global Investors 21 GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC 20 VICTORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC 19 HGC Investment Management Inc. 19 PERISCOPE CAPITAL INC. 18 JANUS HENDERSON GROUP PLC 18 LEVI STRAUSS & CO 17 MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP INC 17 INTRACOASTAL CAPITAL, LLC 17 AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL INC 16 INTEGRATED CORE STRATEGIES (US) LLC 15 BAILLIE GIFFORD & CO 15 15 11. Who uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and fewer filers report? Do those users prefer a different thresh old? Why or why not? Can those users reasonably find alternative sources of data that meet their needs? Why or why not? The Proposal suggests the Commission has acquired alternative sources of data to support its examination and enforcement programs, and to conduct research. However, the Commission’s track record of enforcement actions and research publication provides little ev idence is provided in support of this assertion. There is little discussion in the Proposal of using Form 13F data to inform effective rule -making to ensure fair and orderly markets. As the Office of Inspector General and the SEC evaluates the effectivenes s of Federal securities laws, Form 13F data can provide valuable insights with respect to establishing, for example, the threshold for public company reporting. The current thresholds for public company reporting adopted under the Jumpstart Our Business St artups Act (JOBS Act) in 2012 from 500 to 2,000 shareholders of record have led to many large companies staying private for longer. An analysis of Form 13F filings reveals only 78 exchange -listed companies have more than 2,000 13F filers and 749 companies have more than 500 13F filers. Thus, more than 3,250 reporting companies have less than 500 13F filers. As the number of institutional shareholders declines, the quality of the market for the company’s shares may also suffer as it becomes less likely for a double coincidence of wants necessary for a buyer and a seller of shares to transact. Low -quality markets in individual securities may be subject to increased volatility and price manipulation. Inevitably such markets suffer outflows to more liquid securi ties. Figure 11.1 Frequency Distribution of Number of Form 13F Filers Per Listed Stock The Proposal is intended to reflect the change in the size and structure of the U.S. equities markets since 1975 but seems to make adjustments based only on changes in market values. To fully understand persistent and ongoing volatility in the markets for indiv idual equity securities, more information about the activities of market participants is required. 16 The financial media also relies on Form 13F filings as a source of news flow. Financial media plays a crucial role in the capital markets ecosystem providin g critical scrutiny of the activity of market participants. Financial media is a conduit of information to retail investors. Media industry pressures and the advent of the Internet have lessened the grip of the traditional financial news media. Internet -based sites have been more adept at click -bait and monetizing financial news. Lowering the cost of information for quality financial news providers by improving the accessibility to company filings and information is in the public’s interest. The Commission’ s EDGAR site for filings is highly -trafficked. Logs for access to the site, discontinued in June 2017, regularly show more than 20 million daily pageviews. The launch of the new EDGAR Full -Text Search tool in August 2020 provides users access to the full t ext of electronic filings since 2000. While the website makes it easier for retail investors to search Form 13F filings by issuer symbol, for example, the EDGAR website could be made more consumer -friendly and its functionality improved . Increasing the fre quency of Form 13F filings and the number of securities included on the Official List can help financial newsgroups to focus on investment activity beyond the select group of investment managers and companies tracked in the current environment. Increasing the frequency of Form 13F reporting, together with the number of investors and securities covered, may increase capital formation through underwritten public offerings. Over time, underwriter access to more timely Form 13F reports will improve the ir order book -building and allocation process for offerings and placements. The Proposal to eliminate the filings of the majority of managers risks further limiting access of small institutional investors to primary offerings and placements. 12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? How do the costs differ for larger and smaller m anagers? How much internal time do managers devote to compliance with Form 13F? What are the external costs, such as the cost of a third - party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? We request comment on the direct comp liance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13F, including the estimates in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers. No comment. 13. We also request comment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect costs, such as the potential for front - running and copycatting. Do commenters agree that these indirect costs are incurred? How do these indirect costs differ for larger and smaller managers? Are there other or different indirect costs that are incurred in connection with Form 13F? What are those and how would they be affected by the proposed amendments? The overwhelming majority of investment managers cannot legitimately claim they incur significant indirect cos ts associated with front -running and copycatting in connection with Form 13F. Position sizes held by investment managers relative to trading volumes are such that front -running based upon Form 13F filings, even if the reporting deadlines were to be reduced dramatically below the current 45 days. High -frequency trading firms or agents that monitor Depositary Trust Corporation (DTC) Security Position Reports (SPRs) may have an opportunity to realize gains by front -running large orders. Copycatting based upon Form 13F filings may be a strategy pursued by more market participants. However, it is unclear whether there are any costs incurred for smaller investment managers. In cases where there are disclosures under Schedule 13D, large investors may incur a cost i f investors push market prices up before implementation of the order is complete. Such risk is significantly less for disclosures made on Form 13F with the lag in reporting. Indeed, one of the benefits of increasing the 17 frequency and timeliness of Form 13F reporting would be to allow markets to incorporate such information into market prices more quickly. 14. Rather than the staff conducting periodic reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold, should we instead adopt a periodic automatic adjustment to the Form 13F reporting threshold? If so, how often should the reporting threshold be automatically adjusted? If we adopt an automatic adjustment, what measure should we use to make the adjustment? Should we use consumer price inflation measures such as the CP I or PCE? Should we use stock market growth or stock market returns instead? Is there a different measure that would be more appropriate? If so, please explain why. If we use any of these measures, how should they be measured and as of what date? If we use an adjustment based on stock market growth or returns, the adjustment could be positive or negative compared with the present level. Would such an automatic adjustment raise any additional issues that the Commission should take into account in considering such an automatic adjustment? Instead of establishing automatic adjustments to the reporting threshold, the Office of Inspector General should establish procedures for the Commission to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the 13(f) disclosure program and update reporting requirements as appropriate. 15. Should we, as proposed, eliminate the omission threshold? Why or why not? Yes. Given the wide size range of the corporate issuers, it is difficult to select an omission threshold tha t would not unduly limit transparency or be unwieldly for investment managers to implement. 16. If the Form 13F reporting threshold is raised to $3.5 billion as proposed, to the extent it is not already reported on a voluntary basis, would investors and t he markets find the disclosure of smaller holdings information for larger managers valuable? Why or why not? Smaller holdings of large managers may be important to market participants and regulators interest in price impact and market manipulation . The pri ce impact associated with the trading patterns of large managers in less liquid companies can be significant and may cause a “pump -and-dum p”-like situation inadvertently drawing in unsuspecting retail investors . 17. Among Form 13F filers with at least $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities under management, is it costly to report small positions? Why or why not? How many of these filers’ positions have fewer than 10,000 shares? How many of their positions are valued under $200,000? What is the increment al cost of reporting these small positions on Form 13F? Is the incremental cost significant? Are there other costs associated with identifying these specific positions for purposes of excluding them? Are there other reasons that it would be beneficial to k eep the omission threshold? Some large managers may prefer to obfuscate their holdings with the length of their Form 13F filings. In addition to considering any change in the omission threshold, the Commission may evaluate the utility of the filings by cer tain types of investor such as bank holding companies and broker -dealers. From a n issuer or retail investor perspective, it may be preferable to eliminate managers where holdings represent 18 structured note and index hedg ing related positions as opposed to t hose that reflect a directional view regarding the underlying security of a specific issuer . For the quarter ending March 31, 2020 of the 1.95 million positions reported in the Information Table s of the Form 13F filers 913,714 positions were for less than 10,000 shares and 716,167 were for less than $200,000.2 18. Rather than eliminating the omission threshold, should we increase it? If so, what part should we increase? Should we adjust only the share limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust only the value limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust both components of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we, for example, increase the share limit to 50,000 and the value limit to $1,000,000? The omission threshold should not be increased . For the quarter ending March 31, 2020 of the 1.95 million positions reported in the Information Tables of the Form 13F filers 1.40 million positions were fo r less than 50,000 shares and 1.2 1 million positions were for less than $1,000,000. 19. Should we mirror the adjustment to the omission threshold proportionately to the adjustment we are proposing for the Form 13F reporting threshold using stock market growth? Would such an adjustment result in a significant decrease in securities reported on Form 13F? Would such an adjustment impede the ability of the public to observe the impact managers have on the markets? Adjustments as proposed would significantly re duce the number of securities that are required to be reported and will reduce comparability as many investors will continue to disclose all positions in a single “data dump” instead of adding steps to omit securities not included on the Official List or b elow the omission threshold. 20. If we maintain an omission threshold, should we adopt a mechanism for automatic future adjustments of the omission threshold? Should future adjustments be for the share limit, for the value limit, or for both? What is an a ppropriate mechanism for adjusting the share limit? No. 21. Should we require managers to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F? Disclosing additional identifying information in the summary table as structured data may be useful. 2 An additional 14,186 positions were less than $200,000 when t he 50 identified non-scaled Form 13F Information Table values were corrected to divide by 1,000. 19 22. Should we require managers to provide the CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, of other managers identified in their 13F report? Yes. Others may find the consolidated reports including other managers useful. However, consolidated reports obfuscate rather than illuminate when it comes to identifying investment activity. 23. Would this additional identifying on Form 13F be useful information? If so, how? Additional identifying information about investment managers is useful because the naming convention of various funds often makes it difficult to identify the investment ultimate decision -making organization. 24. Would disclosing this information be unduly burdensome for 13F filers? No. 25. Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13F’s requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifie rs such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? The Commission has rec eived complaints from a wide variety of market participants about the expense associated with acquiring market data, including security identifiers, from exchanges and other data vendors. Leading ETF firms include the ISSUE SYMBOL, CUSIP, ISIN, and SEDOL f or underlying securities when reporting daily holdings and prices for listed ETFs. Main Street retail investors likely find the ISSUE SYMBOL provides more utility than the CUSIP, ISIN, or SEDOL. Nasdaq discontinued a daily list of securities on the primary listing exchanges. The NYSE lists issue symbols on its website over 240 different web pages. The availability of identifiers for other security types may present challenges . Global standardization of identifiers is beneficial for market participants and t he Commission should endeavor to facilitate the availability of structured information for security identifiers in Form 13F reporting. Others may find Column 8, voting authority, useful but I am not among them. 26. Should we require filers to round all dollar values listed on Form 13F to the nearest dollar and remove the requirement to omit “000”? Should we, alternatively, maintain the current rounding conventions? Should we adopt some other rounding conventions? Should we no longer permit rounding? Approximately 50 Form 13F filers regularly fail to divide the position values by 1,000 each quarter. While this represents only a small portion of the number of filers, it presents a challenge for those seeking to use the data. The error may stem from a la ck of appropriate internal controls or a result of human error. The errors may be limited to the Information Table or may also extend to the summary page. To the extent 13F filers perceive the Commission is paying attention to the filings, for example, as a result of the proposed rule, compliance likely will improve, and errors may naturally decline. 20 Table 26.1 Form 13F Filers Reporting Non -Scaled Position Values, Quarter Ending March 31, 2020 CIK Name City State Value Total 1715163 CARILLON TOWER ADVISERS, INC.

Filers of non-scaled filings are defined as those who report position values in the Information Table of the initial Form 13F filing that are not divided by 1,000. Amendments are not considered in the above analysis. Value Total ($000) as reported on the summary page of the filer’s Form 13F. 21 27. Are there any other amendments we should make to streamline Form 13F or simplify its instructions? If so, what are they? There is a lack of consistency in reporting of securities. There is significant variation in the TITLE OR CLASS as well as SH/PRN. The Official List of 13(f) securities should specify the security type. Currently, according to the instructions, the investor must choose either ""shares"" (SH) or ""principal amount"" (PRN). In order to better reflect changes in the securities ma rkets, it may be helpful to classify nonconvertible debt and preferred securities with a stated maturity as “PRN,” preferred securities without a stated maturity as “PRE,” and convertible debt and preferred securities as “CVT.” The classification of secur ities as shares (SH) could usefully be limited to corporate nonfinancial equities with exchange -traded funds identified as “ETF,” closed -end and mutual funds as “MX”, real estate investment trusts as “REIT,” limited partnerships as “LP,” financial service, insurance, banks, BDCs, and mortgage REITs as “FIN,” and special purpose acquisition companies and other shell companies as “SHEL.” The entry total reported on the summary page of the Form 13F would have greater utility if it were defined as the total number of unique securities rather than the number of positions reported in the Information Table. 28. Will our proposed technical amendments increase the accuracy of Form 13F data? Yes. 29. Will our proposed technical amendments make Form 13F data easier to understand and more accessible to the public? Yes. 30. Would these proposed technical amendments impose costs or burdens on filers? No meaningful increase once the transition is made. 31. Does the amendment appropriately reflect the effect of the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 24, 2019, decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media on the type of information that is required to substantiate confidential treatment in accordance with Exchange Act sections 13(f)(4) and (5) and ru le 24b -2 thereunder? No comment. 22 32. Would relieving smaller managers from the compliance burdens of Form 13F reduce costs and enhance competition and add efficiency, including enhancing the ability of smaller managers to compete in the market? To what extent, if any, would the benefits be passed on to investors in the form of lower management fees and/or enhanced services? Would the proposed increase in the Form 13F threshold protect smaller managers from harmful behaviors such as front -running? Would r educing this risk for smaller managers promote capital formation by encouraging these managers to invest more in small and mid -size portfolio companies? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers benefit investors? The current Form 13F reporting require ments are not a compliance burden to institutional investors and thus there will be no reduction in fees or enhanced services for investors. There is little evidence to suggest small managers suffer from widespread front -running of Form 13F filings and thu s no impact upon capital formation. 33. Would the proposed technical amendments increase efficiency by enhancing the accuracy of Form 13F data? Are the cost estimates appropriate? Yes. 34. Would the proposed additional identifying information increase efficiency by making it easier to identify a Form 13F filer’s other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over 13(f) securities? Yes. I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments to the Commission’s on the P roposal. I recommend the Commission consider lowering the reporting threshold to $50 million from $100 million, increasing the frequency to monthly reporting, and expand ing the Official List to include corporate debt and equity securi ties of public and private companies above a certain size or value.

The San Francisco NIRI chapter includes investors relations officers at 76 publicly held companies headquart ered in the San Francisco Bay area . These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and N asdaq , have a combine d market capitalization of approximately $2.2 trillion . We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million , would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark . This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our member s’ compan ies as well as other public companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede companies’ ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive our members of timely information about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies . We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our member s’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our member s’ compan ies as well as other U.S . public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small - and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment manage rs who would fa ll under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting , so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. We also agree with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee , who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduc e transparency and the public’s access to market information . She also question ed whether the SEC “has the authority to purs ue” those changes by pointing out that the “enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold. ”1 2 While o ur member s agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on their ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and monitor activists far outweigh any potential cost savings for investment managers. In addition, the proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules . For the above reasons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate 1 As Commissioner Lee point ed out in her dissenting statement : “To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter (emphasis added) . The text is clear: Congress set a statuto ry reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it. Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting,” July 10, 2020 , available at: https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for institutional investment managers to provide more dis closure, rather than less transparency. Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 directed the Commission to require 13F filers to report short positions each month, while Section 951 of Dodd - Frank instructed the SEC to require 13F filers to annually disclose their votes on executive compensation matters. Governance.3 Rather than reduce transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by working with Congress to support monthly reporting, requir e the public disclosure of short positions, and reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period . To achieve these objectives , we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors , issuers , and the exchanges on a wide range of market transparency issues, including potential 13F reforms, propos ed rules to address “short and distort” abuses, and the modernization of 13D reporting.4 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation.

We urge the Commission to withdraw the Proposed Rule. The University of Virgin ia (“UVA ”) is a public institution of higher learning guided by a founding vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of talented students from all walks of life. It serves the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the world by developing responsible citizen leaders and professionals; advancing, preserving, and disseminating knowledge; and providing world -class patient car e. UVIMCO provides investment management services to UVA and certain other nonprofit organizations that support UVA’s mission. The endowment and other long-term funds managed by UVIMCO are vital to UVA ’s pursuit of its mission and vision for the future. Because Form 13F disclosures are an important input into UVIMCO’s investment process, the Proposed Rule would negatively impact our ability to support UVA’s mission. UVIMCO uses the information included in Form 13F to monitor our external investment managers’ activities; to perform cost-effective due diligence on a broad group of prospective new managers; and to conduct portfolio risk management. The Proposed Rule would limit our effectiveness in each of these three areas. The information we receive from our managers other than through Form 13F disclosures varies widely in terms of its content, format, and timing. Consistent Form 13F data across our portfolio allows us to supplement and confirm this reporting . This enables accurate, efficient, and consistent monitoring of our investments . Thus, Form 13F disclosures , as provided under current law, play a critical role in our portfolio monitoring process. Form 13F reporting also enables us to cost-effectively conduct due diligence on a broad set of prospective new investment managers . We use Form 13F data to develop a preliminary understanding of prospective managers’ strategies based on their publicly reported portfolios . This initial screen expands the universe of prospective investment mana gers that we can consider with limited staff ing resources . As a result, in this area and others, Form 13F disclosures facilitate cost- efficient capital allocation. Finally, we use the information disclosed on Form 13F to better understand risk exposures across our portfolio. Form 13F data allows us to map our underlying investments to various industry, geographic, and other concentrations in our portfolio. In additi on, Form 13 F data enables us to understand the ownership structure s of our underlying investments . The Proposed Rule would significantly limit our ability to assess these risk exposures , impairing our portfolio risk management capability . Form 13F disclosures reduce the cost s and improve the accuracy of our investment activities, and thus serve as an important resource for our stewardship of UVA’s long -term assets. Incomplete or inconsistent information is of limited utility for each of the purposes described above. The current Form 13F reporting threshold provides a level of consisten t transparency , creating an even playing field which inures to the benefit of all investors. Although we support the C ommission ’s goal of reducing regulatory costs for small managers, we note that the Proposed Rule would materially increase investment diligence and monitoring costs for institutional investors. If the Proposed Rule were adopted, UVIMCO would cease receiving Form 13F disclosures from a majority of our public equity managers (in number and value) . We encourage the Commission to consider the costs that the Proposed Rule would impose on institutional investors . The returns generated by UVIMCO provide crucial financial support to UVA , which decreases the financial burden on students, patients and taxpayers. We urge the Commission to withdraw the Proposed Rule , as we believe that current law appropriately balances regulatory costs for managers with benefits for investors and market transparency . However, in the event that the Commission determines to proceed with the Proposed Rule, we urge the Commission to red uce the proposed $3.5 billion filing threshold . Our analysis indicates that a smaller increase in the threshold to $500 million would mitigate most of the negative impacts on our own processes and cost s. We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments and welcome further discussion with the Commission. If you have any questions or wish to discuss our comments in greater detail, please do not hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, University of Virginia Investment Management Company"

Instead, we urge the Commission to withdraw the proposal as submitted and hold a public roundtable to consider alternate forms of 13F moderni zation, as recently proposed by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance. 1 NIRI Chicago is one of the largest NIRI chapters in the United States. Our diverse membership represents compani es across a variety of industry sectors, primarily in the Chicago area and in adjacent states of Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, and Tennessee, as well as the counselors that serve them. We believe that the proposed rule, which arbitrarily increases the reporting threshold 35 times to $3.5 billion, would have a detrimental impact across our membership base. NIRI Chicago’s member companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, have a combined market capitalization of approximately $1.1 trillion; however, mid - cap or smaller companies comprise 67% of our membership. Small and mid -cap issuers typically have a larger percentage of mid -size fund managers owning their stock, as fund managers with AUM above the proposed reporting threshold are often pre cluded from taking sizable positions in smaller companies. The proposed rule would effectively remove the reporting requirement for over 4,500 funds, or nearly 89% of 13F filers, which will no doubt result in a loss of market transparency for our mid -, sma ll-, and micro -cap members. Not only would this impede shareholder engagement, including identifying new holders, but it would also deprive our membership of any advance warning of position -building by activist investors. We also believe that the ne gative impact of the proposal also extends to our large - and mega -cap members, who also regularly confer with their investors throughout the year in line with a common commitment to shareholder engagement and dialogue . While the top investors in larger companies often manage funds that are above the proposed reporting threshold, as an organization we counsel our members to find investors that exhibit long- term 1 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659 (February 4, 2013), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4- 689 (October 7, 2015), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691 (December 7, 2015), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . p 773- 262-1090 NIRI Chicago f 435 -604- 6049 P.O Box 60363 info@nirichicago.org Chicago, IL 60660 www.nirichicago.org investment thinking. As such, shareholder engagement efforts should extend to smaller funds, who may have the ability to grow into larger shareholders over time. Cultivating these relationships remain the cornerstone of shareholder engagement best practices. Many of our chapter members also counsel small - and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies may be some of the most vulnerable to this rule, having fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance , investor targeting, and activist defense, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulema king. We agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules; however, we view the sig nificant loss of market transparency under the proposed rule as an inappropriate solution that fails to consider the varied concerns of a wider variety o f market participants beyond asset managers. We’ll also point out that this loss of transparency comes about as the SEC has been asking issuers to increase their transparency; thus we cannot help but note the double standard. With the proposal eliminating the disclosure requirement for the 4,500 firms that fall below the $3.5B threshold, institutional and retail investors would both be deprived of the publicly -available holdings information that is useful for making investment decisions. For the above reas ons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.2 These include transparency -boosting elements, such as the reduction of an outdated 45- day reporting period, as well as the inclusion of short positions and other types of securities like derivatives. We believe that it’s important for the Commission to co nvene a public roundtable for the purpose of better understanding the potential ramifications of such a rule, as well as the views of a wider range of potentially affected market participants, including issuers, retail shareholders, and market exchanges. A more thoughtful approach could address the real concerns of institutional investors, while simultaneously considering proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation.

"David Trick, Executive Vice President, CFO, Treasurer, Ambac Financial Group Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7843320-223825.pdf,,"September 25, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: We are Ambac Financial Group , Inc. (NYSE: AMBC) (“Ambac”) , a financial services holding company whose principal subsidiaries, Ambac Assurance Corporation and Ambac Assurance UK Limited, are financial guarantee insurance companies currently in run -off. This letter is an addendum to the comment letter s issued by the National Investor Relations Institute , the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and the NYSE opposing the newly proposed reform to Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. Because Ambac is a signatory to th ese letter s, and we support all of their content, we will not repeat them here. Instead, to further register our opposition to the current proposal, we will provide an additional example of the way in which it would harm our company (and similarly situated companies) and our shareholder engagement program. One of Ambac’s key value drivers is its ability to use federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs ”) to reduce its future tax liability and therefore increase shareholder retur ns. Ambac’s consolidated NOLs total $3.7 b illion as of June 30, 2020 , which at the current 21% Federal tax rate could reduce future taxes paid by up to $777 million . Ambac Financial Group One World Trade Center, 41st Floor New York, NY 10007 212.658.7470 Under U.S. tax law, a corporation’s ability to utilize its NOLs is limited if there were a cumulative change , during a three -year look-back period , of 50% or more in the company’s ownership by shareholder s owning 5% or more of the corporation’s stock . Based on Ambac’s current market capitalization, such a change would limit its NOL utilization to approximately $5 million per year. Ambac and other publicly traded corporations with significant net operating losses have incorporated provisions such as Article XII of Ambac’s Amen ded and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (see here) into their charters. These provisions contain substantial restrictions on transfer s of stock in order to help restrict investors from becoming 5% shareholders . Accordingly, Ambac and other similarly situated corporations monitor shareholder position s by reviewing Schedules 13F, as well as Schedules 13D and 13G. In the past, as shareholders have approach ed 5% ownership, Ambac has contact ed them to remind them of the consequences of becoming a 5% shareholde r. The proposed $3.5 billion filing threshold would make it much more difficult for Ambac to proactively identify when investors are approaching a 5% ownership and to proactively engage with them before they breach the limitations outlined in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation . Under the SEC’s current proposal, Ambac may not become aware of larger hold ers until an investor has already reached 5% ownership triggering either a 13D or 13G filing . This reduction in transparency heightens Ambac ’s exposure to experiencing an undetected owne rship shi ft that could , in certain circumstances, result in a material limitation being placed on its NOLs and therefore potentially impairing shareholder value . In conclusion , the proposal under consideration will limit the ability of publicly traded corporations with NOLs, such as Ambac, to manage the risk of investors becoming 5% shareholders and may limit those corporations’ ability to preserve their NOLs, which are often a key component of value to shareholders. We are barely 1 0 years removed from one of the worst financial crises in our history, from which a key takeaway was the need for public companies to improve their shareholder engagement programs. While m uch progress has been made in this area , eliminating the very transp arency that has driven this progress would be a signif icant step backwards. We therefore urge the Commission not to adopt the proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI to improve market transpa rency and foster more effective issuer -investor engagement. We are in full support of reducing the 45 -day reporting period, requiring 13F filers to disclose short positions, and implementing legislation that requires monthly position disclosures. Please contact me directly should you want to discuss further, and I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge”) is a leading North American energy infrastructure company with common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange and we appreciate the opportunity to provide our comments to the Commission on the Proposed Rule. At Enbridge, we are committed to transparency and disclosure ab out our business and how we conduct it. We recognize that transpa rency about our perfo rmance is essenti al to building trust with our stakeholders, including all the communities we operate in, as well as our sha reholders. We believe that active engagement with our shareholders and other stakeholders on an o ngoing basis through a variety of avenues is key to facilitating open and informed dialogue. Just as we hold ourselves to high standards of transparency, we expect all market professionals to do the same, including through 13F filings. For Enbridge, 13F filings are an important source of timely inf ormation about our investor base and help us to identify our investors and plan and prioritize our investor interactions and engagement. Issuers rely on the current state of market tr ansparency to execute on their long-term strategies, run their businesses effectively and protect agains t activist shareholders that may not have the long-term interests of the issuer and its shareholders in mind. The Proposed Rule would be detrimental to market transparency and deprive issu ers of the timely informati on they need. We recognize that the Proposed Rule presents the Commission wit h an opportunity to eliminate the administration burden for 90% of institutional investment manag ers. However, when such opportunity is weighed against the erosion of the level of transparency that i s central to the Commission’s mission to “maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets”, we believe that withdrawal of the Proposed Rule is imperative. For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Com mission withdraw its Proposed Rule. Sincerely, Enbridge Inc.

In the propos ing release, the SEC suggested the updated reporting threshold would promote the goals of Section 13(f) by increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. We do not believe l imiting transparency into the ownership of public companies will further those goals. We belie ve the proposed changes would have the largest impact on small -cap companies such as DMC Global Inc . There currently are 211 institutional holders of DMC Global Inc . Of those, 49 would no longer have to file a 13F under the SEC’s proposed higher reporting threshold. This represents 23% of our institutional shareholder base , but more importantly , it represents a majority of the active institutional investors with which we regularly communicate. The rule change would significantly impair our ability to identify and engage with non -passive investors , and w e would lose the ability to measure the effectiveness of our investor r elations efforts. The change also would hinder our ability to effectively target investors predisposed to understanding and appreciating our business model, strategy and size , and would increase the risk of ambush activism as we would be unable to track activist investors that may be building a position in our stock. Public companies such as ours and the broader U.S. securities marketplace are not well served by providing anonymity to so many institutional investment managers. We cannot effectively engage with our share holders when we do not know who they are . In addition, the proposed rule changes would put additional pressure on the sell -side research industry , particularly those analysts covering small and micro -cap companies. T hrough their corporate access programs, t hese firms play an important role in introducing institutional investors to the management teams of the companies they cover. We have discussed t he proposed rule change with each of the analysts who cover DMC Global Inc., and all stated the modification would likely have a negative effect on their corporate access service offerings , putting additional pressure on the sell -side research industry. 2 We ask that the SEC con sider the full implications of these proposed rule changes , and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the Form 13F disclosure regime t o improve transparency. The need for effective shareholder engagement is more important than ever, and this proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the SEC t o withdraw this proposal. Sincerely, Geoff High Vice President of Investor Relations"

(“Vistra”) , a leading, Fortune 275 , integrated retail electricity and power generation company based in Irving, Texas . We are writing to express our opposition to the amendments proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission ”) to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers . We believe that the Commission’s proposal would res ult in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public ly-traded issuers . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with our shareholders and deprive us of timely information about investment funds or activist investors that may take a position in our company . While we support modernization of these ownership disclosure rules, we believe the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on the ability of U.S. issuers to engage effectively with shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for certain investment managers . Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency We believe that amending the Form 13F threshold would impair shareholder e ngagement by triggering a substantial loss of market transparency. We estimate that with the proposed increase in the 13F threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, we would lose insight into approximately 20% of our current shareholders. The 13F filings are the only comprehensive source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. The 13F data is not as timely as it could be, but it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors a re buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Without the reports, we would be left to rely on Schedule 13D and 13G reports which are only filed by beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of our stock. This, in turn, would limit our ability to track ownership changes . This reduction in transparency would hamper our September 25, 2020 Page 2 efforts to engage with sha reholders at a time when shareholders, companies , and policymakers have reached consensus about the critical importance of shareholder engagement. The loss of this essential 13F data would also impede our company’s ability to attract new long - term in stitutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these pr actices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Increased Risk of Activism As a company position ed for long -term growth, we believe that the loss of 13F data would also expose us to a greater risk of activism by short -term -oriented fund managers who may wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis and demand measures that may not be in the interest of our long -term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly and time -consum ing distraction. Without the 13F data currently available to us , our company would be unaware if a short -term activist , who falls under the $3.5 billion threshold , is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after one of those activist funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often greater) position. This delayed visibility and awareness of such activist funds ’ ownership and opportunity for engagement could create a meaningful difference in the substantial time and financial resources invested to arrive at a resolution. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw these proposed 13F amendments . Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the Commission to instead consider other reforms that have been proposed by various organizations to promote more timely and complete disclosures , such as reducing the 45 -day reporting period and supporting monthly disclosure by 13F filers.

We believe that the SEC's proposal would result in a significant and disproportionate loss of market transparency to our company and other midcap, small and micro issuers and investors. Increasing the threshold by 35 times to $3.5 billion would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to avoid disclosure. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, unnecessarily weaken prudent corporate governance practices, impede our ability to proactively attract new investors, and make us more vulnerable to activist shareholders. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency While not as timely as we would like for them to be, the 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to public companies. Monitoring the investor base is a fundamental and critical activity of a public company, and the inability to identify investors would have negative consequences. Under the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion, 43 percent of SCl's current investors would avoid disclosure. Our company has been publicly traded for close to 50 years with a current market cap of approximately $8 billion. We use 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. While every investor is important, 13F allows us to prioritize our conversations with those investors who will derive the most benefit from those conversations including our largest investors and fund managers as well as those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. We are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders, engage effectively with them, and measure the effectiveness of our shareholder outreach. Many companies, like us, actively reach out to shareholders to ensure their concerns are being addressed. This active outreach, which is often referenced in the proxy, is intended to improve corporate governance and align management with shareholders. Without the 13F filings, we would not have the ability to identify and engage many of our top shareholders on these critical topics. 1929 Allen Parkway• Houston, Texas 77019 • www.sci-corp.com Negative impact on our ability to attract new investors The loss of 13F data also would disproportionately impact our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased risk of ambush activism Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors due to uncertainties caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic , our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce funding of critical long-term initiatives, or take other measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Conclusion and Recommendations While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the disproportionate and negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments. We support the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the 45- day reporting period, and requiring the public disclosure of short positions.

Since the threshold was put in place many years ago, new uses for this data have developed among academics, market researchers, and indeed the SEC. However, no discussion or estimates of the cost of losing the majority of this valuable information have been raised. Increasing the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. A great number of money managers are known to talk among themselves , sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. Less transparency and less data are never good thing s for any smal l investor, or any securities market for that matter. A dditionally , in the event of a significant market correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further, it could be argued that during such a time that reliable data and disclos ure is needed even more. I look forward to your reconsideration of this proposal. Yours s incerely, Fiona Donald"

I strongly oppose the Proposal’s efforts to decrease the quarterly disclosure of equity holdings on Form 13F by increasing the disclosure threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion. This would p ut transparency at risk for both issuers and investors, reducing access to information and greatly undermining the current disclosure system. The above proposal would eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets. If anything, I would suggest there is a case for greater transparency and more timely access to 13F filings, and that a reduction in the current 45 - day reporting period w ould not be unreasonable. From the point of view of smaller publicly traded companies, there is a concern that this is the only way for them to try to determine which investors are buying or selling their shares. The spirit of this Proposal appears to be at odds with the Commission’s mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation. To proceed with this course of action would be to undermine a disclosure system that has existed in an effective and su ccessful manner for decades. More information is better. The SEC have been a key constituent in the democratisation of information and disclosure, allowing everyone in the country instant access to filings and reports over the internet. You are doing a gr eat service to the industry, please don’t change. I respectfully ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Yours sincerely, Martin Latto"

If passed, this rule change would also allow one of QUAD’s ten largest institutional shareholder s to go dark. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter.

We represent members who are investor relations officers at 111 publicly held companies. These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, have a combined market capitalization of over $2 trillion . We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million, would allow 8 9 percent of current 13F filers to go dark. This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our members’ companies as well as other issuers in the United States. According to an IHS Markit analysis of the Russell 3000, an average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list.1 We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our member s’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year.

NIRI New York Chapter | 2 cannot be replaced by retaining stock surveillance firms, which thems elves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small- and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. While our members agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership d isclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on public companies’ ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and monitor hedge fund activists far outweigh the minimal cos t savings for investment managers. We ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Soci ety for Corporate Governance.2 We believe that both investors and companies would benefit from more timely and complete disclosure through a reduction in the 45 -day 13F reporting period and the public disclosure of short positions. To achieve these objectives, we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors, issuers, and other stakeholders on potential 13F reforms and other market transparency issues, including proposals to address “short and distort” abuses, the repeal of the OBO/NOBO rules, and the modernization of 13D reporting.3 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation. 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Am endment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659 (February 4, 2013) , available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689 (Octob er 7, 2015) , available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691 (December 7, 2015 ), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 3 See Professors John C.

"Tim Galbraith, 
Chief Investment Officer, Innovation Beta",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7825724-223744.pdf,,"1 September 24, 2020 Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-100 RE: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (File Number S7-08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Innovation Beta, I would like to provide comments regarding the proposed rule change to raise the 13F reporting threshold for investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billion. a) We are AGAINST raising the threshold as we believe the data collected from the 13F process provides valuable information and transparency for regulators and other market participants. b) We are FOR the elimination of the omission threshold. As background, I am the founder and chief investment officer of Innovation Beta, a fintech startup that measures and identifies institutional investor conviction. We are a consumer of financial data, including 13F filings . Our methodology is blind to the filer - we do not produce copycat investment strategies. W e extr act valuable investment behaviors through a rigorous computational process. It is this very analysis of 13F data that allows us to make informed observations. Our objections focus on losing the information that the 13F program has provided regulators, policymakers and investors since disclosure began in 1978, and how the higher threshold will diminish the value of the collected data. The unintended consequences of the proposal are significant . The 13F reporting program has three critical objectives: First, to create a central d ata repository. Second, to improve the data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus shed light on the impact and influence of investment managers on the securities markets and public policy. Third, to increase investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets. We believe that the proposed rule change will detrimentally impact each of the three mandates. Regarding the first objective, while the SEC analysis projects about 90% of the total dollar value of securities will still be reported , the data repository goal will “go dark” with the elimination of nearly 90% of the number of filers. Forgoing all the data points for nearly 5,000 filers each quarter will be a loss for future regulators, market participants, researchers and investors. Data becomes more useful the more you have of it. With storage costs near zero and the cost of collecting data falling, the effort t o continually add to the body of knowledge has high marginal value . It is only by having that archive can it serve its valuable purpose. Regarding the second objective, the goal of measuring the influence of institutional investors on the markets and public policy will be negatively impacted if the threshold is raised. The resulting data will simply reflect the concentration of mega advisers whose portfolios resemble an index-influenced market, saturated by large-cap holdings. Further, investors will lose the ability to detect investment mandate aberrations. Let us first ask, why is collecting data on only large advisers more desirable than gathering data on many advisers ? The higher $3.5 billion threshold will permanently distort nearly 40 years of 13F holdings data. The Q4 2019 13F submissions provide a powerful illustration of how myopic the data will become. 674 advisers exceed ed the threshold with a median asset value of almost $12 billioni. As shown in Figure 1, t he med ian number of portfolio holdings for these large advisers is 516, uncannily similar to the acclaimed 2 index, compared with just 83 holdings for the 4,638 advisers below the threshold. With investors shifting to passive index strategies, is it any surprise that the largest advisers would have equity portfolios that resemble large indices ? Of course, large advisers’ 13F reports are a compilation of multiple strategies and products, so it is specious to suggest one 13F filing represents a single investment strategy . Sizeable holdin gs are another way to express how “the big got bigger.” Over the past decade, the largest index-focused advisers were the prime beneficiary of the $1.8 trillion outflow from active mutual funds to passive index products . The Investment Company Institute reported the largest five fund complexes grew 51% since 2005 and now control over half of the ETF and mutual fund assets. The 13F program tells that story at the portfolio level as large fund complexes pressed their growth bets by adding more index products . Since 2013 (the first year EDGAR mandated XML format) the median hol dings count for advisers above the $3.5 billion threshold increased 20% from 431 to 516, where as advisers under the threshold, likely active and discretionary with no index offerings to offer in scale, had a modest 6% increase to 83 holdings. (If these sub-$3.5 billion advisers had index offerings the median holdings count would be much higher than just 83 names.) It is hard to imagine that a fundamental, dis cretionary adviser would construct a portfolio and employ an analyst team to oversee 516 equity positions . The proposed rule change will result in a reduction of act ive managers in the database. Our evidence suggests that the proposed rule change will skew the 13F data to mimic passive index constituents, thus the SEC is not gathering information on large investment decision- making and behaviors (which was the 1978 original ‘gaps in information’ the Commission sought to understand), but rather the decisions from index publishers. Future holdings analysis will not provide a nuanced portrait of capital allocation decisions, risk management, or securities analysis, but rather simply index-tracking asset advisers characterized by extreme cross-ownership of index constituent stocks. Rather than comfort, that should be a concern . Index portfolios that are tracked by real dollar investment advisers total over $34 trilli onii. As the SEC reviews the burden of 13F reporting, it bears reminding that none of the index providers – who technically ‘manage’ zero assets - are burdened with preparing an ADV, submitting a Form 13F, or obtaining a ny license from FINRA. In figure 2 , our analysis further shows a 20% decrease in just six years of 13F filers who own the top small and mid-cap index securitiesiii. If the pr oposed rule change is adopted, we believe the resulting 13F database will reflect and cement the index tilt as large advisers collectively share more large-cap exposure than mid or small. To be clear, we robustly believe low-cost transparent index-tracking ETFs have benefitted investors, but the rule change will create a future database that is less representative of the broader market. A higher threshold will result in thousands of advisers employing active investment strategies vanishing from the data set, along with the ability for investors to appraise style drift and deviations from investment mandates. Reduced transparency allows a growth adviser to own value stocks undetected and an ESG adviser to buy a coal miner . Additionally, academics and regulators will Figure 2 Small Cap (SLY)Mid Cap (MDY)Large Cap (SPY) 2013 6.3% 10.6% 43.3% 2019 4.9% 8.4% 47.7% Change -22.5% -20.1% 10.2%What % of Total Filers Own Top 20 Index Names? 3 lose the ability to study security level decision-making and other behavioral finance dimensions among active managers. As active managers disappear from the 13F radar, the mechanisms of how fundamental data such as earnings, cash flows, and economic data influence security selection and portfolio construction will become a black hole . The SEC will lose a valuable information trove that can be used to study and monitor investment behaviors from active managers and from advisers that focus on mid and small capitalization companies. The third original policy goal, investor confidence of the markets, will suffer from a higher threshold. In short, investors need the SEC. We agree with many of the submitted comments that transparency is needed across all markets and their participants. The rule change will reverse that progress, particularly for listed companies that welcome transparency to identify shareholders, as crisply argued by the National Investor Relations Institute. Companies and institutional and individual investors need and expect more transparency . Here’s a 13F tale about how t he small stuff still matters for investor confidence: Current Form 13F reporting gives regulators and investors a quick overview of over 5,000 investment advisors. That review can begin with an observation of simple errors. For example, for Q4 2019 there were over 5,000 raw 13F submissions . One advisor from upstate New York reported owning over 110, 000 holdings – almost three times the holdings of BlackRock – despite an asset valuation of just $67 million. Another advisor from Florida reported 466 securities valued at over $14.9 trillion – twice the valuation of reported 13F assets from BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and Fidelity combined . These two examples showcase the typical errors found in 13F reporting: Data fields are transposed and the instruction to round dollar values to the nearest 1,000 is occasionally neglected. Some are quick to claim innocent clerical errors happen; 125 amendments were filed to make corrections. But what do errors – or their persistence – tell investors and the SEC about the compliance, oversight policies, and systems at a regulated investment manager? The core information on a 13F is basic – how many shares are owned and what is the value? A regulated, licensed, professional money manager should have that down cold. One advisor which filed its 13F in February 2020 reported a whopping 550,527 security holdings, then a week later filed two amendments to correct the holdings count to only 24 securities. Is it a coincidence that three years earlier the founder at that firm settled with the SEC for Adviser Act violations and paid a fine of $250,000? In this case, we cannot discern coincidence or something more systematic, but simple, persistent errors provide the first window into evaluating the operations robustness of an investment advise r. Getting the easy stuff correct for a professional money ma nager should be basic but it is not always the case. Take Apple stock: At the end of Q4 2019, there was only one closing price of Apple at $293.65 per share. Out of the 3,263 unique filers who owned Apple, their 13F reports inferred 338 different closing prices, some as low as $0.26 and as high as $324,000.00iv. To be fair, the majority of filers had the right price, but regulators and investors can still be baffled about the advisers who widely miss ed the mark. Raising the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would eliminate thousands of advisers from being able to provide a first answer to the question: “Is my house in order?” We favor eliminating the omissions threshold. The elimination of the threshold would increase marke t transparency and reduce the 13F compliance report burden, as complete portfolios would not need to be filtered twice. Currently, the first filter is reviewing portfolios to only report eligible 13F securities and the second filter is eliminating holdings with less than 10,000 shares or less than $200,000 in value. Removing filtering steps also reduces the chances for errors and the time it takes to complete the filing. The proposed rule change analysis reported that 23% of filers included at least some positions that fell within the omission threshold. In other words, they were more transparent than required. We suggest it may be more cost-effective to ""reply all"" and send the entire portfolio as t he de minimis filter adds a level 4 of burden. Connecting complete 13F reporting to trade management and portfolio accounting systems would also reduce errors and lower burdens for advisers and SEC staff. In closing, thank you for the opportunity to comment. The issues raised by the proposed rule change were thought-provoking and motivated us to look for clues in the 13F data to provide a reasoned response. The new threshold proposal will permanently change the complexion of the data and eliminate valuable insights for future users. More transparency, not less, will help the SEC discharge its duties and provide greater confidence in the financial markets. As a final thought, I encourage the SEC to quickly vote on the proposed rule change; in trader parlance, “Fill or Kill .” In the 13F ecosphere, there are many small businesses built on tracking and reporting position changes, and large data-driven organizations have trading processes that depend on the continuity of 13F reporting. They, their clients and all market participants are surely anxious to have a quick resolution to this proposed rule change. Gathering comments for 60 days, followed by staff review and analysis before a Commission vote will keep business activity stalled pending a resolution. I urge the SEC to quickly come to a decision.

"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7825713-223735.pdf,,"September 24, 2020 Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street , NE Washington, DC 20 549-1090 via Email: rule-comments@sec.gov Re: File Number S7 -08-20; Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, 85 Fed . Reg. 46016 (proposed July 10, 2020) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. Parts 250 and 249) (the “Proposing Release”); Release No. 34 -89290 Executive Summary : Stifel believes that the Commission should not revise the reporting threshold for Form 13F because increasing that threshold to $3.5 billion would:  eliminate an efficient source of information that is one of the most effective tools for issuers of 13(f) securities to identify investors and monitor investor engagement;  have a disproportionate effect on small -capitalization companies who, on a relative basis, often rely more upon Form 13F data than other sources, such as investor relations firms or stock surveillance programs, to a ssist with these objectives; and  not result in significant cost savings to investment advisors because the sophisticated portfolio management and reporting software currently employed by most investment advisors is generally utilized for other regulatory purposes as well, which reduces the incremental burden of assembling the dat a to be filed on Form 13F. Ladies and Gentlemen: Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel”) is a full service retail and institutional wealth management and investment banking firm and is a registered broker -dealer and registered investment advisor. Stifel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE: SF), a financial holding company, and is affiliated with broker -dealers, registered investment advisors, retail and commercial banks and trust companies. Stifel appreciate s the opportunity the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) has given for public comment on the proposed rule amending Form 13F to, among other things, revise the reporting threshold for Form 13F from $100,000,000 to $3.5 billion. Stifel beli eves that, along with other full service financial services firms, it is in a position to understand the benefits and detriments of revising the reporting threshold. As a full service retail financial advisory firm, Stifel provides financial advisory serv ices to approximately 1 million advisory and brokerage accounts with assets under management of over $300 billion. A number of these retail investors and their financial advisors may use information disclosed pursuant to Form 13F to determine potential in vestment opportunities based upon disclosed investment by institutional investors. Additionally, Stifel is a leading mid -market investment bank , providing its clients with services with respect to M&A advisory, general advisory, debt capital markets and equity capital markets. Although Stifel has a diverse range of clients across all capitalizations; Stifel’s investment banking practice franchise is a market leader with respect to small -capitalization companies.1 Stifel’s investment banking clients rel y on Form 13F information to identify their largest institutional investors, to determine how to allocate the time and resources of their senior management for investor meetings and to determine strategies and opportunities for capital raising, including i dentifying potential investors. Stifel is also affiliated with three registered investment advisors, each of which currently files Forms 13F and one of which would no longer be required to file Forms 13F if the reporting threshold is increased to $3.5 bil lion. Stifel write s in opposition to the revision of the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion and believes that such a revision to the reporting threshold would result in an adverse impact on the 13(f) disclosure program’s three primary goals, including a disproportionate impact on available information regarding small -capitalization companies. Stifel believes that revising the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, as proposed, and permitting 89.2% of current Form 13F filers to cease filing wou ld have a negative impact on each of the three primary goals of the section 13(f) disclosure program as noted in the Proposing Release.2 Although the Commission notes in the Proposing Release that “under the proposed amendments, the aggregate value of sec tion 13(f) securities reported by managers would represent approximately 75 % of the U.S. equity market as a whole, Stifel believes that exempting nearly 90% of current filers substantially reduces transparency and the data available to market participants. 1 Together with its affiliate, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Stifel is the largest provider of U.S. small and mid -cap equity research coverage . Additionally, Stifel has ranked:  1st in all managed equity deals since 2010 for equity transactions less than $500 million market cap ;  1st in all managed equity deals since 2010 for equity transactions less than $1 billion market cap ;  1st in bookrun equity deals since 2010 for equity transactions less than $500 million market cap ;  6th in bookrun equity deals since 2010 for equity transactions less than $1 billion mark et cap ; and  1st among middle -market investment banks for public M&A transactions under $1 billion . 2 The Proposing Release states that the three primary goals of the section 13(f) disclosure program are: (1) to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers, (2) to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impa ct of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence, and (3) to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. As the Commission notes in the Proposing Release, the pool of users of Form 13F data has expanded to include many parties that were not originally contemplated, including the issuers of 13(f) securities, academics, market researchers, and market particip ants, including investment managers. As has been noted in comments to the Proposing Release from a number of issuers of 13(f) securities, these issuers use this data for a variety of reasons, including (1) identifying and engaging with long -term investor s, including allocating management resources to focus on an issuer’s most important investors, and (2) monitoring the activity of potential activist investors. Stifel also notes that many of its issuer clients use Form 13F data to assist in determining st rategy for capital raising, including identifying potential investor classes or individual investors, and measuring effectiveness of outreach efforts to such potential investors. Without taking into account the detrimental effects of the proposed revisi on to the reporting threshold on other categories of users of Form 13F data, the loss of one of the most effective tools for issuers of 13(f) securities, including investment banking clients of Stifel, to identify investors and monitor investor engagement argues for the withdrawal of the proposed rule change , and Stifel concurs with the many comment letters submitted by or on behalf of issuers of 13(f) securities opposing the proposed threshold revision.3 Similar to other issuers who have submitted comment s and Stifel’s issuer clients, Stifel would lose significant visibility into its institutional investor base as 128 of the 358 current Form 13F filers who report holding Stifel stock would not be required to report pursuant to the proposed $3.5 billion rep orting threshold.

Based upon our research, Stifel identified 512 small cap mutual funds (inclusive of small cap growth, small cap value and small cap core funds, as well as microcap funds) with total assets of $534.25 billion, average assets of $1.04 billion and median assets of $266.8 million. Using the proposed reporting threshold of $3.5 billion, only 36 of the 512 funds would be required to report on Form 13F. These funds would represent only $287.4 billion, or 54% of small cap assets, far short of the 75% of the U.S. equity market as a whole. Furthermore, Stifel was formerly affiliated with an investment advisor with a small cap focus ; this investment advisor intended to cap its funds at $3 billion in investable as sets as it felt that as a small cap advisor, that was the maximum amount of assets it could invest without altering its investment strategies or its funds’ liquidity. Thus, a $3.5 billion reporting threshold may fail to capture fully mature small cap inve stment advisors. As a result, small cap companies would be substantially underrepresented in the Form 13F data. Furthermore, Stifel believes that small capitalization companies in particular rely upon Form 13F data for these purposes as these companies o ftentimes do not have the wherewithal that mid or large capitalization companies have to engage investor relation firms , stock surveillance programs or other assets to assist with these objectives . As previously stated, Stifel is affiliated with three other registered investment advisors, each of which currently files Forms 13F and one of which would no longer be required to file Forms 13F if the reporting threshold is increased to $3.5 billion. Following discussions with personnel of its affiliated regi stered investment advisors, Stifel believes that investment managers with $1 00 million under management are capable of shouldering the compliance burden of filing reports on Form 13F, particularly given the sophisticated portfolio management and reporting software utilized by most investment advisors. This software is already utilized for other regulatory purposes by advisors and decreases the burden of assembling the data to be filed on Forms 13F. For the reasons set forth above, Stifel believes that the Commission should not revise the reporting threshold for Form 13F . If the Commission does determine to revise the reporting threshold for Form 13F, Stifel strongly believes that the reporting threshold should not be raised above approximately $250 millio n, which is the median fund size for small cap mutual funds and above which more than 50% of small cap mutual funds would not be required to report on Form 13F. As we continue our business of creating and preserving wealth for the American people , Stifel stands ready to work with the Commission to determine other approaches by which the Form 13F program can be modernized and made more effective . Sincerely, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated"

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street , N.E. Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: Archer Daniel Midland Co. Comments on File No. S7 -08-20: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Archer -Daniels Midland Company (“ADM”), we respectfully submit comments on Securities and Exchange Commission File No. S7 -08-20, the Commission’s proposed rule to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold for institutional investment managers. ADM strongly supports the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( “SEC”) goal of modernizing the Form 13F reporting requirements . However , we believe that the SEC’s proposal to increase the rep orting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion will significantly reduce transparency in the marketplace and adversely impact issuers by limiting the ability to identify and engage with an ever -evolving shareholder base. ADM utilizes 13F filings to i dentify new or changing positions in our investor base, and to carry that information forward when planning and prioritizing investor outreach activities both for our investor relations team and for executive management. Limiting our visibility into this information would make this process more difficult and would result in missed opportunities or inefficient utilization of company resources. While ADM does utilize alternative sources for shareholder information, namely a stock surveillance service, the 13 F information is the most complete and accurate source of information available to us. Under the Commission’s proposed higher threshold , ADM would lose visibility into the holdings of approximately 60% of our total institutional investor base, including one of our top 25 shareholders. 2 Through our participation in investor relations organizations, we also are aware that this change could have an even more profound negative effect on smaller issuers, both due to the size of their average investor, and to their more limited ability to engage outside stock surveillance firms as an alternative. We ask that the commission withdraw this proposal and instead consider more targeted reforms to modernize the 13F reporting process, with a focus on increasing market transparency and taking into account the needs of large and small issuers, institutional and non -institutional investors , while addressing important areas such as dollar thresholds, frequency, filing deadlines, and short -position reporting. We believe tha t a more targeted and inclusive rulemaking effort to modernize the 13F reporting requirement, as suggested in the petitions and comments submitted by interested organizations such as NAM, NIRI, the NYSE Group, and NASDAQ, whose views we endorse and incorporate by reference , would result in a better outcome for both issuers and shareholders alike. Yours very truly, D. Cameron Findlay"

We believe that the SEC's proposal, which would allow nearly 90 percent of current 13F filers to avoid reporting, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly traded companies in the United States, and would add considerably to the current lack of transparency associated with the proliferation of dark pools, algorithmic and high­ frequency trading and the 45-day lag with current 13F filing requirements. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long­ term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company. While 13F data is not as timely as we would like, it is the only snapshot of data that we have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, at a sizable fee, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. In addition, for a company of our size, stock surveillance is currently cost prohibitive. While the proposal cites as a benefit the reduced burden for smaller asset managers, the reality is that technology advancements in the years since the 13F rule was issued make reporting markedly easier and have lessened the burden to the point it would not be unreasonable for these firms to report weekly, if not daily. To no longer require reporting of activity for funds below $3.5B introduces an opaqueness to our markets that does not serve anyone well. As our markets, Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 24, 2020 Page2 and trading itself, become more complex with the evolution of technology and financial instruments, we need more transparency of information, not less. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this proposal on our company and our obligation to regularly engage in dialogue with our investors throughout the year. As a $288M+ market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction in 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow approximately 28% of our current active 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company, the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold is more valuable.' Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot say yes to every investor request, so we attempt to give priority to not only our largest investors, but also to those investors with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings and who share the same long-term views as our senior management. With this proposed increase in the l 3F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important subset of investors, denying us the opportunity to effectively allocate our limited time to important investors. Negative Impact on Attracting New Investors The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F information to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively build awareness of our business with investors that share the same values as management. Under the proposed threshold , the loss of transparency around who is holding, as well as buying/selling our shares each quarter, would hinder the ability of our company to continue to effectively target new investors. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures and thus transparency, is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that public companies ""provide as much information as is 1 According to Edelman's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman , ""SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,"" July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yaJ100.com/new /sec-propose d­ rule-change-tep-193708183. html. 2 Ms. Vanessa Countryman September 24, 2020 Page3 practicable"" to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. 2 Our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high. Activist investors could take advantage of that volatility, using the increased lack of transparency and higher reporting threshold for their benefit and against the interests of long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we take actions that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3 .5 billion threshold is building a contentious position until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. We believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists far outweighs the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission's inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,3 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,4 and the proposed updates to the SEC's rules on shareholder resolutions.5 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, ""The SEC's three-part mission --maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors --takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure -providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions -is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission .... We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.""

(NYSE: DELL) , a leading global end -to-end technology provider, headquartered in Round Rock, TX, I am writing to express our strong opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe the Commission’s proposal will significantly reduce market transparency and will adversely impact the ability for corporate issuers, suc h as Dell Technologies, to effectively engage with shareholders. According to the SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Le e’s statement opposing the Commission’s proposal , raising the form 13F filing threshold to $3.5 billion from $100 million would result in approximately 90% of current 13F filers going dark. With respect to Dell Technologies, a $92 billion company, we expect that this proposal would cause us to lose visibility into as many as 55% of our shareholders , and 15% of our top 100 shareholders that currently file form 13F’s. Such a significant loss of transparency will greatly impact our ability to effectively engage with shareholders and to identify activist investors, the great majority of which fall well below the Commission’s proposed filing th reshold. Dell Technologies and many other companies have hoped that the Commission would update its ownership disclosure rules to encourage more contemporaneous and transparent 1 3F reporting. However, even if current 13F data is not as timely as we would prefer, it remains the most reliable source of ownership information available to Dell Technologies. 13F filings are the only method for us to understand the “street name” investors use when buying or selling our shares each quarter. Stock surveilla nce firms will not serve as an adequate or cost -effective substitute since they rely on quarterly 13F data as a foundation for their research efforts. While we, along with many other companies and investors, agree that SEC should modernize its ownership d isclosure rules, we believe the proposed 35 -fold increase in the 13F threshold does not properly consider the impact to issuers like Dell Technologies that depend on 13F data to effectively engage with our shareholders and activist investors. For the fore going reasons, we join the overwhelming number of voices opposing the Commission’s proposal and request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Inves tor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.1 Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete 1 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to 2 disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45 -day reporting period.

The Proposal would reduce information available to the public about the identity of public companies' shareholders and the amount of stock owned by those shareholders. Not only would this reduction in transparency undermine the SEC's mission of protecting investors, it would also hamper our efforts to engage with our shareholders. A successful shareholder engagement program requires companies to be able to identify their shareholders to help facilitate outreach and engagement. Yet few sources of this information currently exist. Under the current system, ""Objecting Beneficial Owners"" (""OBOs"") are not required to identify themselves as owners of a company's common shares unless they cross the 5% beneficial ownership threshold applicable to Securities Exchange Act Sections 13(d) and 13(g) reporting. That is a very high threshold and not a practical source of sufficient information for robust shareholder engagement . Consequently, we and other public companies utilize Form 13F filings to identify and facilitate meaningful engagement with our shareholders . The substantial loss of market transparency that would be triggered by amending the Form 13F threshold as proposed would be detrimental to our investor relations program and to shareholder engagement . As 13F filings serve as the single source of information regarding which institutional investors are buying and selling stock each quarter, we are particularly concerned that the Proposal will impair our ability to identify all but our very largest shareholders. Over 900 institutional investment managers reported holding our common stock as of the end of the second quarter of 2020. We believe that number could fall to below 400 if the proposed amendments are adopted. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Park was founded in 1954, became a public issuer in 1960, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1985. With a market capitalization of approximately $240 million, Park falls within in the category of issuers that would be most disproportionately impacted by the Commission's proposed changes to the regulatory regime for 13F reporting. Rule 13f-1 benefits both investors and public issuers by providing otherwise unavailable information regarding institutional investor holdings. The disclosures attendant to the 13F filing process provide issuers and investors with information needed to make more informed decisions about how to invest in public companies and how to engage with shareholders, respectively. The Commission's proposed changes would cause small issuers like Park to lose visibility into the ownership of a large majority of their shares outstanding. This loss of visibility would hamper the ability of small issuers like Park to engage with their shareholders . Finally, reduced visibility into the ownership of sector and fundamental peer companies would also inhibit the ability of small issuers to proactively attract new investment. Park requests that the Commission maintain the reporting threshold at $100 million.

This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, at a sizable fee, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a star ting point for their research efforts. While the proposal cites as a benefit the reduced burden for smaller asset managers, the reality is that technology advancements in the years since the 13F rule was issued make reporting markedly easier and have les sened the burden to the point it would not be unreasonable for these firms to report weekly, if not daily. To no longer require reporting of activity for funds below $3.5B introduces an opaqueness to our markets that does not serve anyone well. As our markets, and Ms. Vanes sa Countryman September 23, 2020 Page 2 trading itself, become more complex with the evolution of technology and financial instruments, we need more transparency of information, not less. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this proposal on our company and our obligation to regularly engage in dialogue with our investors throughout the year . As a $136M+ market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction in 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion w ould allow approximately 28% of our current active 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest invest ors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company, the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold is more valuable .1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our investor relations personnel and our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors fo r one -on-one calls or meetings . We cannot say yes to every investor request, so we attempt to give priority to not only our largest investors, but also to those investors with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their hold ings and who share the same long -term views as our senior management . With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important subset of investors , denying us the opportunity to effectively allocate our limited time to important investors . Negative Impact on Attracting New Investors The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F information to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively build awarenes s of our business with investors that share the same values as management . Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding , as well as buying /selling our shares each quarter , would hinder the ability of our company to continue to effectively target new investors. 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Ms. Vanes sa Countryman September 23, 2020 Page 3 Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures and thus transparency, is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that public companies “provide as much information as is practic able” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic.2 Our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high . Activist investors could take advant age of that volatility, using the increased lack of transparency and higher reporting threshold for their benefit and against the interests of long -term shareholders . The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we take actions that may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not kn ow if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is building a contentious position until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. We believe that the negative impact s of th is 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists far outweigh s the modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth compa nies,3 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty.

Please note that we are 65% owned by another public company, D.R. Horton, Inc., ticker symbol: DHI. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow approximately 90 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long- term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buyi ng or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a greater than $850 million market cap company as of September 23, 2020, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. Based on reporting data dated June 30, 2020, w e estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow the holders of approximately 13% of Forestar’s outstanding shares, or nearly 40% of our public float, to evade disclosure under the proposed rule, which includes Forestar’s largest shareholder outside of D.R. Horton, Inc., Long Pond Capital, L.P. ('t FORESTAR 2 While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those institutions are passiv e, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable .1 In fact, out of the approximately 15.1 million Forestar shares currently accounted for through 13F filings, approximately 9.1 million shares are held by active managers, and approxim ately two - thirds of these active shares would become exempt from reporting under the proposed rule. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possi bly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activi sm but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. This aspect is especially important for Forestar, as we are in the early stages of a significant growth plan that includes the need to issue both additional debt and equity. In planning for capital markets transactions, our team gives considerable focus to the investor information provided by 13F filers. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “ provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global C OVID -19 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Demo cracy, ” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed- rule-change -step-193708183.html . 3 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for own ership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other m easures that may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021- 22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008- 09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be espec ially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors.4 As of June 30, 2020, there are three 13F filers that hold FOR who are known as activists or who have launched activist campaigns on companies in the past; one of these three filers would become exem pt from reporting under the proposed rule, which significantly increases the risks of an activist attack on our company. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshol d is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Fina nce Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty.

And to be able to see what percentage of the pro's portfolio went to that stock ... and at what price ... that's an incredible benefit to the little guy that the SEC is hoping to serve.Millions of small investors are becoming financially literate because of a revolution of financial information disclosure on the internet. Please do not remove one of the little guy's best sources of information about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing.Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the pro investors we follow - great investors who intentionally limit the size of their investment portolios - pros like Guy Spier, Mohnesh Pabrai and Allan Meecham, all of whom will be excused from filing by this change.

Refinitiv is one of the world’s largest providers of financial markets data and infrastructure, serving over 40,000 instituti ons in over 190 countries. Refinitiv’s platfor ms and services provide details of the ownership of public equities worldwide, collated from numerous sources including U .S. SEC filings. Quarterly 13F disclosures filed with the SEC are a key source used to identify the institutional ownership of U .S.-listed securities. 13Fs are widely regarded by the financial industry as the only reliable and unbiased source of holdings data in U .S. stocks. The holdings extracted from 13F filings and presented in Refinitiv’s platforms and services are used by particip ants across the financial industry, the corporate sector, academia and beyond to provide insight into who holds positions in U .S.-listed securities. We are writing to strongly oppose the core change in reporting threshold for Form 13F , specifically, to: “Amend rule 13f -1 and Form 13F to raise the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion to account for the changes in the size and struct ure of the U.S. equities market since 1975. ” Refinitiv applauds efforts to modernize regulation , and we support many of the smaller aspects and technical amendments included in the Proposed Rule . However, we believe the change in reporting threshold of the Proposed Rule will reduce transparency and h inder shareholder communication to such a degree that it will negatively impact market efficiency and be detrimental to the U .S. public equity market. The Proposed Rule will reduce transparency in the market . As a leading provider of financial data with expertise from our decades of market leadership and cutting -edge research through products like Lipper and StarMine , we know that the quarterly holdings information on 13F forms is a vital resource. 13F information is vital for professional and retail investors, as well as regulatory bodies, news agencies, and a variety of other interested parties. Hundreds of billions of dollars of investment decisions are influenced by this information. Eliminating 90% of this information, as the Proposed Rule aims to do, will negatively impact all parties involved, including the institutional investment managers who this rule purpor ts to benefit. Transparency impacts the markets in multiple ways. Academic research has shown that decreasing transparency is associated with decreasing liquidity and higher cost of capital.1 If capital becomes more expensive then entrepreneurship and innovation suffer and the economy as a whole suffers. Lack of transparency also critically impacts investor confidence. Investors need to know what they’re buying. When you go to the grocery store to buy a box of breakfast cereal, there is a li st of ingre dients on the outside of the box telling you exactly what is inside. Without that label, fewer people would buy that cereal. When you go to a pharmacy and buy a bottle of pills, there is a label on the outside telling you exactly what is in the bottle. Without that, very few people would buy that drug. When you go to buy a mutual fund, you should also be able to see what exactly you are buying. Few people will buy a financial product without knowing what it contains. Note that there is already an indu stry which offers products lacking transparency, and that is the hedge fund industry. But direct investment in hedge funds is not available to most individuals. The Commission’s arguments are based on the one -sided viewpoint of the institutional investor. However, the vast increase of retail investor participation in U .S. equity markets since 1975 has not been appropriately taken into account . The Commission has ignored the changes to the U .S. equity markets since 1975. Specifically, the Commission has overlooked the impact of the Revenue Act of 1978 which created the opportunity for defined contribution retirement plans. While the original intentio n of that act may be debated, the fact is that over the years since, the importance of defined contribution retirement plans has continued to be reinforced by further legislation and, clearly, by market participation. 1 Daske, Holger, Luzi Hail, Christian Leuz, and Rodrigo Verdi. ""Mandatory IFRS reporting around the world: Early evidence on the economic consequences."" Journal of accounting research 46, no. 5 (2008): 1085 -1142. DeBoskey, David Gregory, and Peter R. Gillett. ""The impact of multi-dimensional corporate transparency on us firms’ credit ratings and cost of capital."" Review of Quantitative Finance and Accou nting 40, no. 1 (2013): 101 -134. refinitiv.com As of 2019, those plans were used by more than 59 million US workers .2 Most defined contribution plans include the choice of investing in various fund products offered by institutional investment managers. Participation in these plans is voluntary, but research has shown that those who do participate to the fullest extent are vastly more prepared for retirement than those who do not. Encouraging participation is thus a benefit to those individuals, and to society as a whole because it reduces the burden on the government to provide support. So, it is crucial that US workers have confidence that the retirement products they are being offered are reliable and trustworthy. They need to know “what is on the inside”. They need the transparency offered by the current reporting thresho ld of $100 mill ion. If they don’t have that confidence, they will suffer; markets will suffer; institutional investment managers will suffer; and the U .S. economy as a whole will suffer. The Proposed Rule will impact the ability of corporate issuers to communicate effec tively with current and prospective shareholders . Unlike other SEC filings, 13F disclosures have no holding position restrictions so the approx. 5,400 13F filings made each quarter under the long -standing $100m equity assets threshold provide access to a broad and deep collection of holdings across the U .S. equities universe. Applying the Proposed Rule’s equity assets threshold of $3.5bn would see a massive reduction in the volume of holdings identified across U .S. equities, potentially a reduction of 90% . Refinitiv and other market data provider s’ products and services would be unable to provide the same level of insight on institutional ownership, severely restricting the ability of corporate issuers and their advisers to identify and communicate with t heir shareholder base. For a corporate issuer, being able to identify its shareholder base is critical to ensure they are communicating with the right institutional investors. Given that effective and regular communication with shareholders is a basic corporate governance obligation for a publicly listed issuer this proposed rule will undermine their ability to meet that requirement . Issuers also need to be able to track and analyze movements in their shares, and data extracted from quarterly 13F disclosures provides the ability to easily assess position changes as well as new holdings in a stock. 13Fs are also used by issuers and their financial advisors to identify potential institutional investors by, for example, loo king at peer stocks and t heir 13F holders. Issuers and their advisors will be unable to identify potential new institutional investors effectively as that insight will simply no longer exist. Smaller asset managers, the very audience the proposed rule purport s to help, who derive real value from quarterly 13F disclosures as they provide insight into the ownership of small - and mid -cap companies would see that insight lost. Conclusion Refinitiv thus believes that the long -standing $100m equity assets threshold should remain in pl ace. Rather than reduce transparency by raising this threshold Refinitiv encourages the SEC to increase transparency (as is the trend in other jurisdictions such as the UK and the European Union) by, for example, requiring institutional investors to discl osure short holdings and reducing the 45 day reporting period that sees the vast majority of reporting institutions file their 13Fs near or on the final day. Refinitiv appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Commission’s Proposed Rule. We would be pleased to provide any further information or respond to any questions that the Commission or the staff may have.

As advisors to companies about how they should best engage the investment community , we see significant negative outcomes from this proposed change. In exchange for eliminating cheap and automated 13F filing processes , which will at best marginally benefit asset managers, the capital markets will lose transparency into $2.3 trillion of equity investments from nearly 4,500 money managers , according to the National Investor Relations Institute1. We fear the SEC’s proposal will create harm in two ways. It will create much higher levels of vulnerability to under -the-radar activist investors who will be able to build positions in the shadows, putting executiv es and their companies in a bind with little warning. And it will remove a critical source of information companies use today to identify current investors and target potential new shareholders, which is the bedrock of an effective investor relations progr am. Reduced Transparency Creates Activist Vulnerability for Issuers and Their Employees The SEC’s proposal comes at a time when it is asking companies to “provide robust and transparent disclosures about how they are dealing…with the current (COVID -19) environment. ” 2 In our advisory role, we push our clients to communicate openly so investors can better understand their operations , helping 1 National Investor Relations Institute, July 13, 2020, available at: https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Executive -Alert/NIRI -Executive - Alert_ -SEC-Proposes -to-Reduce -Equity-Ownership -Transparency -7-13-2020.pdf 2 SEC, “Coronavirus Disclosure Considerations Regarding Operations, Liquidity, and Capital Resources,” June 23, 2020, available at: https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/covid -19-disclosure -considerations 3 Lazard, “2019 Review of Shareholder Activism,” January, 2020, available at: https://www.l azard.com/media/451141/lazards -2019 -review -of- shareholder -activism -vf.pdf achieve a fair valuation. It is therefore a stunning irony that the very transparency for which the SEC advocates will be impaired if its suggested rule change takes effect. To demonstrate the danger of this lost transparency , consider the number of activist asset managers that fall below the $3.5 billion threshold. According to data from research service Activist Insight , more than 60 percent of activist investors , including prominent activists JANA Partners and Sachem Head, manage assets below the SEC’s proposed $3.5 billion cut -off and would no longer file quarterly reports . The less -than- $3.5 billion threshold includes f our-out-of-ten of the most frequent activists in 2019, according to investment bank Lazar d3. The top reasons for activist engagement include gaining board rep resentation , removal of directors or executives , or to support or oppose a merger or acquisition . All three generate highly disruptive contests that can radically alter a company’s path forward, impacting both executives and the thousands of people they employ . Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency We recommend companies engage with all investors, whether they have a history of activism or not, as soon as their investment becomes apparent . Removing notification through quarterly 13F filings, as the SEC proposes, will make this vastly more difficult, and will force companies to wait for the activist’s “knock on the door,” versus reaching out proactively, as is the best practice. Likewise, a s 13F data is the only accurate source of ownership information available, we believe this proposed ru le, if enacted, would hamper targeting efforts by issuers to identify potential shareholders and thus impair issuer engagement with shareholders . As a result, we see the SEC’s proposed change as a step backwards for shareholder democracy. When we work with publicly -traded clients, we champion transparency , as its elimination rarely promotes optimal valuation and capital markets efficiency . We hope the SEC recognizes this and rather than curtailing transparency , reconsider s this ill -advised proposal . Jeremy Cohen Senior Vice President Jeff Zilka Senior Counselor"

As a publicly traded company , we rely on quarterly 13F filing information to assist in identifying our institutional shareholder ownership. The SEC's proposal, if enacted, would impair our shareholde r engagement efforts, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of information about activist investors that take positions in our stock. We believe that this proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency . The 13F filings are the only source of quarterly ownership information available to our company and other U.S. issuers that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold is more important. The 13F data is essential to our ability to understand and effectively engage with shareholders who hold smaller positions and are interested in growing their positions. For companies like us with lower average trading volume of shares, we would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger peers who will be able to identify their investor base more clearly than we would be able to and target their messaging more effectively . We need this data to recognize the impact and adjust our investor disclosures and messaging when appropriate. The loss of 13F data also would impede our company 's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on public company capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. WASH*REIT The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short-term-oriented fund managers. Without the 13F data we receive now, companies will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure ownership threshold of 5 percent. For these reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance. Rather than reduce 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the 45-day reporting period, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and supporting monthly disclosure by 13F filers. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely , s,ffff Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 2"

The company seeks to expand its industrial portfolio through build -to-suit transactions, sale -leaseback transact ions, development projects and other transactions, including acquisitions. While we endorse the concept of modernizing 13F reporting , we, like ICR and NIRI, believe that the proposed amendments would have negative consequences . Our views in that regard are set out below. As a path forward, we agree with ICR’s and NIRI’s suggestions that the Commission withdraw this proposal and re-propose amendments with the reforms described in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI , the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .2 More specifically, instead of permitting almost 90% of current 13F filers to stop filing and reducing transparency , the Commission should reduce the reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions and support legislation to provide for more frequent disclosure.3 1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf (the “Proposal”) . 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Par agraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pur suant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Na sdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, December 7, 2015, available at https://w ww.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 3 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of sho rt positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. We also believe that the Commission should eliminate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 22, 2020 Page 2 of 3 As proposed, the current reporting threshold would increase from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe that this change would have a dramatic and negative i mpact on public companies and the capital markets . To that end, we echo ICR’s and NIRI’s comments as set out in their letter s to the Commission , dated August 25, 2020 and August 26, 20204 respectively, as well as Commissioner Lee’s comments in her statement regarding the proposal dated July 10, 2020 .5 In addition, we offer the following views regarding the proposal . Significantly Reduc es Access to Public Information and M arket Transparency If the proposed threshold is adopted, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers or 90% of current 13F filers – representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets – will no longer be required to file Form 13F.6 We understand that the proposed threshol d is based on the growth of the U.S. equities market between 1975 and December 2018. While t he Commission estimates that the increased threshold would retain disclosure for approximately 75% of the dollar va lue of the U.S. equities market , the transparency on that dollar value is greatly different no w given the change in investment strategies since then, i.e., the rise in passive/index investing as compared to active investment strategies. Under the proposal, mostly index and passive invest ing will continue to be reported, which does not provide the same transparency as tracking active and activist investing. Further, the proposed threshold does not reflect the value of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, which would be near $500 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We believe that if this proposal is adopted , it will significantly and detrimentally r educe information access and market transparency, which in turn will result in reduced investor confidence and capital market efficiencie s (particularly for smaller capitalization companies) , and further will provide a disincentive for privately owned companies to go public . When Congress first adopted Section 13( f) in 1975, it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” 7 However, the current proposal is antithetical to that legislative intent and will have the opposite effect on public compani es and our capital markets , the efficiency of and the confidence in which is wholly dependent on information access and transparency . Cloud s Crowding Risk The proposal will create a l ack of clarity regarding crowding risk due to fewer hedge fund manager filings. Investors use 13F filings of top hedge fund managers to understand crowding risk and in turn to appropriately hedge their portfolios. Access to information regarding c rowded positions help investors understand how similar their holdings are to the portfolios managed by institutional managers with similar investment styles/strategies. However, under the proposal , the ability of beneficial owners of a company to prohibit their intermediaries from disclosing their identity to such comp any. 4 See NIRI Letter to the SEC, and ICR’s Letter to the SEC . 5 See https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10 6 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ . 7 See https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf citing Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94 -75 at 78 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 179, 261. See also Division of Investment Management: Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F (May 2005)(Frequently Asked Questions), http://www.sec.gov/divsions /investment/13 ffaq.htm, Question 1 at p.1 (“Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States securities markets.”). U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 22, 2020 Page 3 of 4 the absence of fewer number s of 13F filings and filers will hinder the ability of inves tors to understand and assess crowding risks, resulting in obscurity and uncertainty for investors, issuers, and the capital markets . Brokers Win, Investors Lose Brokers, not investors, will emerge as winners in the more opaque market most certain to result from the proposal. After the implementation of MiFID II rules, traditional brokers began to los e relevance as investors started to invest i n a more direct manner, ther eby avoiding broker age commissions. At the same time, investor relations officers started to focus their outreach and capital raising efforts on sponsored research firms/ paid advocates, employees, dealers, vendors and others to actively and directly market their company to and raise capital from investors. However, if the proposal is adopted , companies that currently rely on 13F filings to seek marketing and capital growth insights and opportunities will again become largely dependent on brokers to close t he information and engagement gap . In turn, we believe that t his will lead to higher brokerage commissions and ultimately hinder the growth and efficiency of our capital markets . More Expensive Access to More Limited Information for Companies We believe that a ccess to data will be come more limited and more expensive if the proposal is adopted. The Commission stated that the new reporting threshold would retain data “on over 90% of the dollar value of the securities currently reported.”8 However, t he information void that will be created by the proposal due to the lack of reporting by over 90% of the current 13F filers will mean that the cost of accessing that previously available information will increase, and those increased costs will ultimately be borne by the public companies seeking out that information and in turn borne by investors and the capital markets as a whole . For example, the cost to companies that utilize shareholder surveillance services in an effort to obtain timely and detailed da ta regarding the transaction activity of investment managers will increase, as these service providers currently rely on 13F filings to produce that data . Similarly, companies seeking to obtain a list of their registered shareholders and non- objecting ben eficial owners (NOBO) will have more difficulty accessing this information due to more limited publicly available data that would result from the proposals and likely will need to pay more for that information as a result. 9 Damages Investor Relations and Ultimately Capital Markets Our i nvestor relations team seek s to “know our customer, ” with the customer in this case being investors and other market participants. If companies do not understand their investors or worse are unable to ascertain who their investors are, companies will be unable to improve disclosures, and better communicate with and otherwise help their investors. Investors and other market participants want companies to provide them with more, and better, information, transpare ncy and communications. Indeed, the efficiency of our capital markets depends on the timely public dissemination of accurate information about issuers and their securities, and the Commission has recently and historically called for more transparency with investors, particularly during times of market uncertainty. Companies will be unable to do that if they are unable to readily identify their investors and evaluate investor activity and behavior.10 Companies certainly will be unable, or 8 See https://www.sec.gov/news/press- release/2020 -152 9 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/Mjk = 10 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/MzE = U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 22, 2020 Page 4 of 5 less able , to do that if the proposals are adopted. We believe this will not only negatively impact public companies , but the capital markets as a whole , as described below . Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies in which they invest. Investors now engage more directly with issuers on many important matters, including capital all ocation decisions, long -term strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to seek to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most important duties of our investor relations team is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C -suite executives or directors. Most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available , to properly engage with investors. However, t he Commission’s proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust investor relations engagement that has developed b y excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long -term basis. While companies would continue to receive information from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is more important . Small and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. Additional discussion about these topics follows. Harms Retail Investors Retail investors often will place reliance on a company’s 13F data when they make investment decisions. With the proposal, these investors will have far less information with which to make such decisions, and information that would remain available can be deceiving, particularly as it pertains to micro - and small -cap companies. The 13F filings associated with a micro -cap company could make it appear to an investor that the company has no institutional ownership whatsoever, when that might not actually be the case. In our view, more and more retail investors are seeking to access the capital markets without the assistance of an intermediary and further seek to invest in “start- ups”, i.e., micro -cap and small cap companies. Harm s the Most Vulnerable Issuers and Investors IHS Markit analyzed the 3000 largest companies in the United States to identify which issuers and investors would be most affected by the increase of the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion: • In terms of issuers, I HS Ma rkit found that micro -cap, small -cap and energy companies would be most severely affected by the resulting loss of information access , while mega - cap, large -cap and utilities companies would see the least impact. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 22, 2020 Page 5 of 6 • In terms of in stitutional managers /investors, IHS Markit found that the proposal would noticeably impact alternative /specialty and active/ high turnover institutional investment managers in terms of relief fro m filing requirements , while index /low turnover managers would see little relief from their filing requirements . On average, 55% of the investors, and 69% of the hedge fund investors, on an issuer’s shareholder list would no longer be the subject of 13F fi lings. • Importantly, IHS Markit analyzed the impact on “ activist” institutional investment managers and found that an incredible 86% of activist managers would no longer be required to file 13Fs .11 Activists tend to build concentrated positions and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3.5 billion. This could lead to an even greater rise in activist managers, leading to significant disruptions to the capital markets and to public companies.12 Additional discussion regarding a ctivists follows. Increase s Activism Risks Just as there is a need for greater transparency on the part of public companies with their investors, a company’s need for ownership data is even greater during times of market volatility and uncertainty, when many activist investors seek to take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, public companies would be unable to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus allowing them to “gam e the system” and use the increased lack of transpa rency for their benefit and to the detriment of the co mpany’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes public compan ies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short- term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that the company eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the company’s long -term strategy or the investment strategy of its long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companie s were targeted and 97 proxy contests were launched. 13 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the Commission ’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency w ould be especially unfortunate for companies and long - term investors. In sum, w ithout the 13F data that is available now, companies will not know if an activist manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 day s after the 13D disclosure threshold is crossed and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Further, unless and until the 13D requirements are updated to, among other things, include directors, activists can mask their holdings until it is too late for the company to defend itself. Negative ly Impact s Capital Formation and Markets The loss of 13F data also would impede a company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders 11 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis 12 See https:// ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ 13 See https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post -pandemic -corporate - activism U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 22, 2020 Page 6 of 6 (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies to effectively access the capital markets, communicate with potential investors and to grow their businesses. Under the propo sed threshold, the loss of transparency regarding who is holding as well as buying a company’s equity securities each quarter would hinder the company’s ability to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the Commission should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Unlikely Reduction in Cost Burden We understand that the Commission aims to reduce the cost burden and provide relief to smaller managers who are currently subject to 13F reporting.14 According to Commission estimates, the direct compliance costs per manager can range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually and the proposal can r esult in savings of $68 million to $136 million in addition to savings in indirect costs related to 13F users front- running or copying advisers’ portfolios.15 However, in our experience, the estimates appear to be quite high . Form 13F filings generally are an automated process for investment managers.16 Accordingly, we echo Commissioner Lee’s views regarding the cost analysis in the proposal.17 Lack of Regulatory Authority We, like Commission er Lee, question the Commission ’s authority to increase the reporting threshold . The statute itself provides no support for such an increas e, and in fact appears to set a statutory reporting threshold of $100 million, while authorizing the Commission to lower it, not increase it . The proposing release does not address this, and simply concludes that the statute provides the Commission with the authority to increase the threshold. Further, in our view, any use of the exemptive authority in Section 13(f)(3) would be inconsistent with the limitation on the Commissio n’s au thority in Section 13(f)(1). In other words, the Commission would be using its exemptive authority to turn the statute on its head . For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35 -times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by ICR, NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer- investor engagement.

As outlined below, t he Proposal ’s efforts to amend the quarterly disclosure of equity holdings on Form 13F by increasing the disclosure threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion puts transparency at risk for both issuers and investors and undermine s a disclosure system that already works well. Significant Impact to Availability of Holdings Data The Proposal indicates that it would reduce the number of filers by nearly 90%, but would retain disclosure of over 90% of the dollar value of holdings data currently disclosed through Form 13F. However, Nasdaq estimates that of the approximately 50,000 buy -side institutions, nearly 80% do n ot currently disclose via Form 13F .2 Should the SEC move forward, data for an additional $2.3 trillion worth of assets managed by 4,500 investment managers would no longer be available to investors. Dramatic Reduc tion in Transparency for Public Companies The Proposal would significantly reduce the extent of ownership information made available to public companies of all sizes . The se companies would suffer from a lack of transparency into their c onstituents and asset base s, which would lead to increased costs and impede their shareholder engagement. Small -cap companies – the lifeblood of the U.S. economy – would suffer the most . Nasdaq estimates that managers in the $100 million to $3.5 billion range of reported assets currently allocate 10% of assets to small - and micro -cap companies, equating to 30% of the total assets invested in those companies. Lack of Public Company Input The Proposal was announced with out first seeking input from public compan ies and taking into consideration the potential impact it would have on their businesses. Moving forward with the Proposal would be in direct odds with the Commission’s mission of protectin g investors, maintaining fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street , NE Washington, DC 2 0549 -1090 Re: Proposed Rule on Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7-08-20) Dear M s. Countryman : Nasdaq, Inc . (“Nasdaq ”) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commi ssion’s (“SEC” or “Commission”) Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers proposal (the “Proposal ”)1 and to engage productively with the Commission, U.S. publicly traded companies , and other impacted market participants . We feel that it is important to participate in any efforts to improve the landscape of U.S. capital markets and appreciate the Commiss ion’s efforts made with the intent to ease the burdens for certain investment managers through the Proposal , which seeks to amend the quarter ly disclosure of equity holdings on Form 13F by increasing the disclosure threshold fro m $100 million to $3.5 billion. However, as a longtime advocate for reforming the U.S. capital markets and, in particular, disclosure transparency , we believe that the r educed transparency resulting from this proposal would be harmful to p ublic companies and investors. Nasdaq believes that t ransparency -based initiatives promote stronger investor protections by informing and empowering investors to make more educated inve stment decisions. We consider transparency as crucial to the foundation of the public markets and vital for both an investor ’s and issuer ’s ability to make an informed financial decision . Nasdaq remains committed to support efforts to augment investor prot ections and to enhance the transparency of the U.S. capital markets . As outlined below, the Proposal would significantly reduce transparency for public 1 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89290 (July 10, 2020), 85 FR 46016 (July 31, 2020), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf . Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 2 companies and their investors , would substantially impede engagement by public companies with their s tockholders , would aid activist investors to the detriment of U.S. public companies and their investors, and would deny retail investors and issuers critical information they need to make prudent investment decisions . All of these impacts would disproporti onally affect small - cap companies. Loss of Transparency As we noted in the joint comment letter (“Joint Comment Letter”) on the Proposal submi tted by Nasdaq on behalf of itself and a number of public companies, t he Proposal would significantly reduce the extent of ownership information made available to public companies of all sizes.2 These companies would suffer from a lack of transparency into their constituents and asset bases, which would lead to increased costs and impede shareholder engagement. We strongly agree with SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee’s assessment that the proposal decreases transparency and that it lacks sufficient analysis.3 The SEC said in its proposal that it would reduce the number of filers by nearly 90%, but would retain d isclosure of over 90% of the dollar value of holdings data currently disclosed through Form 13F.4 However, as w e also mentioned in our Joint Comment Letter , Nasdaq estimates that of the approximately 50,000 buy -side institutions, nearly 80% do not currentl y disclose via Form 13F.5 SEC Commissioner Lee correctly noted that t he Proposal would “eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in as sets”6 and limit issuers’ transparency into their constituents and asset bases. Additionally, Form 13F reports are often utilized by issuers to get a better sense of their shareholder base . The Proposal would cause a substantial reduction in the transpar ency and visibility regarding the makeup of the issuer’s investor base and changes over time that may hamper their decision -making . This may cause management to waste their limited resources by concentrating on short -term investors rather than more properl y focusing on longer -term 2 See Joint Comment Letter (Sept. 22, 2020). 3 See SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee ’s Statement on the P roposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (July 10, 2020); available at https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f- reporting -2020 -07-10. 4 Section 13(f) secu rities include shares of exchange -traded funds , which would result in many sponsors and managers of exchange -traded funds that rely on Form 13F data to have less information available to them as a means to ascertain their shareholder base. 5 According to Refinitiv ownership data via Nasdaq IR Insight (June 30 , 2020 ). 6 Supra note 2; see note 1 at pp. 1 6-17. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 3 investors and key issues such as long -term company strategy, corporate governance, and executive compensation. Thus, a decrease in 13F reporting could negatively affect public companies that base certain of their decisions on the information they now glean from the 13F data filed by other important market participants. Also, and a s a direct result, issuers, market participants, and regulators would have a much narrower view of the holders of a particular issuer. Small -Cap Compani es Would Suffer Largest Impact The SEC states in its proposal that “ Raising the reporting threshold for rule 13f -1 to $3.5 billion… would retain disclosure of 90.8 percent of the dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data currently reported while relievin g the reporting burdens from approximately 4,500 Form 13F filers, or approximately 89.2 percent of all current filers.”7 The SEC fails to address, however, that this increase would have a n appreciably disproportionate effect on smaller companies and make i t very difficult for them to determine their owners. As we stated in the Joint Comment Letter, s mall-cap companies are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy and would suffer the most. We estimate that managers in the $100 million to $3.5 billion range of repor ted assets currently allocate 10% of assets to small - and micro -cap companies, equating to 30% of the total assets invested in those companies. The Proposal does not fundamentally address the negative impact of raising the 13F threshold on retail invest ors and small asset managers, many of whom rely on 13F data when making investment decisions.8 Significantly , lessening the disclosure requirements may somewhat lower the costs for some smaller investment managers (e.g., a modest reduction in compliance co sts); it would not counterbalance the loss of critical information for retail investors and other market participants . Undoubtedly, the Proposal would disproportionately affect transparency into smaller companies whose stocks are more likely to be held by the investment managers who would no longer be required to file Form 13Fs . Given that small -caps are often thinly traded , this currently acts as a deter rent for more substantial institutions that may have concerns over the potential negative impact on a stock ’s price if they were to attempt to purchase or sell a large number of 7 Supra note 1 at pp. 17 -18. 8 As of the date of this comment letter , retail shareholders had filed close to 2,000 comments in opposition to the Proposal . Investors routinely review data derived from 13Fs prior to making trading decisions , much the same as they examine Form 4 data on stock trades by corporate insiders. The Commission in 2002 proclaimed the benefits of greater transparency when it decreased the Form 4 reporting period to two business days: “ Making this information available to all investors on a more timely basis should increase market transparency, which will likely enhance market efficiency and liquidity.” Ownership Reports and Tradi ng by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Release Nos. 34 -46421; 35 -27563; File No. S7 -31-02, August 29, 2002. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 4 shares . Also , less substantial institutions can more easily accumulate a significant position in small -cap compan ies, meaning these institutions with less money at their disposal tend to comprise a large r share of the investor base of small -cap companies. We believe it is imperative that the SEC must first more thoroughly weigh the potential harm this proposal may cause smaller companies and capital formation prior to adopting such a proposal . Smaller issuers are anxious over potentially losing visibility into their ownership base . The Proposal also provided modest evidence that Form 13F disclosure s aid “copycatting” and “front -running .” This seems quite unlikely due to the lengthy lag time between when an investment position is established and the disclosure of the position in a Form 13F , as well as the likelihood of professional investors being able to use other methods to gain access to the same information . It is an understatem ent to say that d isclosure of ownership is crucial information for U.S. public companies. In particular, s mall- and micro -cap issuers could be severely impacted by a reduction of transparency into their stockholder base. We believe the negative consequence s that would be visited upon such companies have not been thoroughly enough examined by the Commission. Increased Concerns Regarding Shareholder Visibility and Activist Investors Issuers and investo rs alike rely on Form 13F to determine the shareholders of public companies and consider such filings as essential . Specifically, management can analyze these reports to determine who is assembling a position in their stock.9 The Proposal would increase the vul nerability of issuers to stealthy a ctivist investor s who would be able to acquire positions quietly , which may disadvantage companies and their long-term shareholders . Such activist investors may go undetected , unless their investment position in the company surpasses 5% of the total shares outstanding . This would trigger the submission of the Schedule 13D . If the Proposal is adopted, o f the frequent or occasional activist investors managing over $100 million, disclosure from only 25% of those investors would be retained (meaning approximately 75% would no longer be required to file a Form 13F ).10 The names of the investment managers11 that would fall below the SEC’s proposed $3.5 9 However, it should be noted that since activists can seek confidential treatment of their holdings, coupled with the length of time between an investment and when it is disclosed in a Form 13F, this might lessen the value in Form 13F reporting. 10 According to Refinitiv ownership data via Nasdaq IR Insight ( June 30 , 2020). 11 According to data from research service Activist Insig ht, greater than 60% of activist investors manage assets that currently fall below the SEC’s proposed $3.5 billion threshold and would no longer be required to file quarterly reports . Additionally, a ccording to the investment bank Lazard , the SEC’s newly proposed threshold would effectively allow four of the ten most frequent activists in 2019 to obscure their holdings as they assembled their stock positions. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 5 billion threshold include many familiar hedge fund executives and billionaire s because they do not hold on a long -term basis a substantial amoun t of 13(f) securities.12 The decrease in transparency resulting from the potential adoption of the Proposal would strike s mall- and mid - cap issuers particularly hard since they have a higher percentage of these activist investors .13 Smaller publ ic companies would face an i ncreased risk of activism , whi ch, in turn , may lead to shorter -term decision -making, which may be at odds with a more beneficial long -term company strategy. It may also result in cutting spending on necessary or important initiatives, prompt downsizing, as well as other action s not in the best interests of the company or long -term investors. Last year was a record year for activism according to Activist Insight . In 2019, 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.14 Numerous corporate advisers are now advising companies to expect another wave of activism in 2021 -22 once the pandemic wanes (similar to what occurred following the 2008 -09 financial crisis). Additionally, w hile we believe that an overhaul of Section 13-related disclosures is indeed needed , this is clearly not the proper moment in time to go in the opposite direction and weaken disclosure transparency .15 As the SEC stated in its Proposal, a primary goal of the section 13(f) disclosure program is “to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets .”16 Bearing this in mind , we strongly recommend that the SEC reconsider its stance on shareholder visibility . It has been suggested outside the formal rulemaking process tha t the SEC may have greater flexibility in amending Form 13F because the original purpose of Form 13F reports was not intended to address transparency concerns of public companies and their investors , but rather the rationale was to allow the SEC “to monito r the large positions in the marketplace for integrity.”17 The fact that the Commission may have initially adopted Form 13F to obtain 12 See, e.g., Bloomberg News (Quint), “Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC P lan,” July 15, 2020, available at https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/tepper -einhorn - soros -stock -holdings -would -go-dark-in-sec-plan. 13 According to Refinitiv ownership data via Nasdaq IR Insight (June 30, 2020). 14 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate - governance/insight -preparing -for-post-pandemiccorporate -activism . 15 For example, Nasdaq has long advocated that holders of short positions should be required to make disclosure in parity to that currently required under Section 13 by long holders. Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 16 Supra note 1 at p.9. 17 Kellie Mejdrich, SEC Chairman Defends Investment Manager Proposal, Politico (Jul y 24, 2020). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 6 information for itself, rather than the public more broadly, does not mean that the SEC can amend Form 13F without discharg ing its statutorily mandated obligation to consider the impact of its rulemaking on the public based on how the public uses the information today .18 Increased Burden on Shareholder Communications A central and vital role of any investor relations department of a public company is to monitor its shareholder base. Ownership information is the informational foundation relied upon by companies to communicate effectively with their shareholders . As a result, communications between issuers and investors would be a dversely impacted by the adoption of the Proposal . The resulting inability of these departments to ascertain the names of many key investors would negative ly impact their companies . Nasdaq believes that this is just another unintended consequence of the Proposal and that both issuers and institutional investors would likely suffer from its effects . The proposed threshold would greatly limit the ability of issuers to engage directly with a segment of its shareholders , which would be to the detriment of both the company and its investors alike . Additionally, t he elimination of this vital source of information for companies would make it much more difficult for them to identify current shareholders , as well as to target potential new investors. Investor relat ions departments of public companies heavily depend upon the Form 13F disclosures in their efforts to engage with shareholders, as well as in connection with proxy solicitations and other corporate action s. The processes around annual meetings, including p reparing and distributing proxies and facilitating and tabulating voting, is already arduos in its current form, so reducing current Form 13F filings obligations would even further increase the burden on public companies in executing that process as effect ively and efficiently as possible; particularly for small -cap issuers. These i nvestor relations departments rely heavily up on data derived from Form 13Fs to determine how best to allocate the limited time of companies’ senior management for investors seeki ng in-person meetings or calls . Simply put, t he Proposal ’s higher threshold would deny 18 Whenever the SEC is engaged in rulemaking, it is required to take account of the public interest , which is clear from the plain language of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . See 15 U.S.C. § 78c(f) (“Whenever pursuant to this chapter the Commission is engaged in rulemaking . . . and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall also consider . . . efficiency, compe tition, and capital formation”). This genera l requirement for the SEC to consider the public interest is reinforced in this specific setting by 15 U.S.C. § 78mm, which is one of the statutory grounds that the Commission expressly invokes as authority for its proposed amendment to Form 13F. See Propo sal at 48; see also 15 U.S.C. § 78mm(a)(1) (“the Commission, by rule, regulation, or order, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provisio n or provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder, to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors”). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 22, 2020 Page 7 these departments with the necessary insight they require to decide which investors should be given access to its’ top executives . This is of particular concern for smal ler U.S. public companies in their efforts to effectively gain entry into the equity markets and grow their companies . In sum, t he Proposal would significantly dampen the effectiveness of a public company’s investor relations program , which we do not bel ieve was the SEC ’s intent . Conclusion Nasdaq appreciates the Commission’s efforts to lessen the expense - and regulatory - related burdens for small funds and to protect investment strategie s. However, as a longtime advocate for disclosure transparency, we have concerns that the negative consequences of the Proposal would in the end far outweigh the intended benefits. Access to quarterly disclosure of ownership is critical information for public companies and the Proposal would deprive issuers of timely info rmation about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies . The Proposal , if enacted, would also impair issuers’ engagement with shareholders and impede the efforts of companies to attract new long -term investors . Taken as a whole, the downside of increasing the disclosure threshold to $3.5 billion would greatly overshadow any potential cost savings for investment managers. Nasdaq continues to be a passionate advocate for healthy and vibrant U.S. capital markets and looks forward to work ing closely in the future with both the Commission and the U.S. public company community to develop appropriate investor protections and initiatives . As the complexity of U.S. capital markets continues to grow, Nasdaq calls on the entire U.S. capital marke ts industry to come together with targeted and effective investor protections around a transparency principle to protect the interests of all investors. To echo what we have previously said, i nvestor confidence in all aspects of the capital markets is para mount and critical to ensuring its long -term viability. We believe that a decision by the Commission to move forward with the Proposal would controvert the SEC’s mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capi tal formation. Therefore, w e respectfully ask the Commission to withdraw th e Proposal . Sincerely, John A. Zecca"

Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34- 89290; File No. S7- 08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) is one of the nation’s premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway Com pany subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers. Norfolk Southern is a major transporter of industrial products, including chemicals, agriculture, and metals and construction materials. In addition, the railroad operates the most extensive intermodal network in the East and is a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts. Norfolk Southern is filing this comment letter to oppose the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. The proposed rules will greatly decrease transparency into our investor base and thereby significantly impair Norfolk Southern’s engagement with our investors and our ability to prioritize investor communication with our management team. The Form 13F filings are the primary data source for our shareholder list and shareholder holdings. For the first quarter of 2020, Norfolk Southern had 1,386 Form 13F filers . If the proposed rule had been in effect, 978 of the 1386 filers would not have met the proposed $3.5 billion asset test and would not have filed Form 13F. Instead, only 408 inves tors would have had assets greater than $3.5 billion and would have been required to disclose their holdings in NS stock. Norfolk Southern uses the Form 13F information extensively in our investor relations program and in our shareholder engagement progr am in order to respond to requests from investors for calls and/or meetings with myself and other members of our management team. We consider investor engagement a critical aspect of our duties as leaders of the company, although we also recognize that our time for these activities is not unlimited. To prioritize meetings with investors, the data from our Form 13F filings is important to confirm ownership and the number of shares owned for the investors requesting meetings. We often meet with investors w hose assets under management are below $3.5 billion, and it is important that we have ownership information and visibility into their quarterly trading activity to maximize the value of these Norfolk Southern Corporation Three Commercial Pl Norfolk, VA 23510- 1728 meetings. Importantly, the added value from ensuring efficient interactions is not limited to our company. We regularly hear from shareholders that they benefit from our endeavors to provide needed clarity to the marketplace regarding our business conditions, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty such as the COVID -19 pandemic. Loss of visibility into 70% of our shareholders would negatively impact the efficiency of such interactions. In addition, ownership information and visibility into our shareholders’ quarterly trading activity i s important in evaluating input that we receive during our investor relations and shareholder engagement meetings. We strive to balance the interests of smaller shareholders with larger shareholders’ interests, and the information provided by the Form 13F filings is cruci al to further this goal. Norfolk Southern applauds the Commission’s efforts in modernizing Form 13F reporting. While we would support a modest increase in the filing threshold in recognition of the passage of time since adoption of the current limit, we do not believe that raising the filing threshold to the proposed level would be beneficial to companies or the investment community. In addition, we urge the Commission to consider reducing the time period for reporting to adjust for recordkeeping advanc es and requiring the disclosure of derivative positions to better align disclosure with current trading practices. These revisions would increase transparency to issuers about their investor base and more generally to the investment community. I thank you for the opportunity to provide Norfolk Southern’s comments on this proposal. Sincerely, Mark R. George EVP and Chief Financial Officer"

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: Dominion Energy, Inc. is one of the country’s largest electric and natural gas utility companies with nearly 7 million customers and a public market capitalization of over $65 billion. We are a signatory to two existing comment letters that oppose the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional managers: • The National Investor Relations Institute’s (NIRI) comment letter dated August 28, 2020 • The New York Stock Exchange’s comment letter dated September 21, 2020 We also support the opposition of the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Asso ciation as described in their joint comment letter dated September 15, 2020. We submit this supplemental information to describe the anticipated negative consequences for Dominion Energy if the Commission’s proposal is approved. Effective shareholder eng agement is critical to our ability to successfully optimize returns to our shareholders, employees, customers, and communities. Form 13F disclosures play a key role in that process by allowing our management team to evaluate shareholder positions and effi ciently allocate resources to maximize the quality of our investor relations efforts. We believe those efforts benefit shareholders and the company alike. Robust engagement with shareholders ensures that the strategic, financial and operational profile o f our company reflects feedback from our investors which directly impacts, among other things, our access to and cost of equity financing to support our growth. James R. Chapman Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond , VA 23219 DominionEnergy.com Page 2 of 2 We rely on investor demand, via equity capital markets, to fund investments that serve ou r customers. Over the five -year period of 2020 to 2024, we have publicly indicated that we expect to raise around $2 billion of equity capital to fund, in part, approximately $5 billion of annual growth capital investment in critical energy infrastructure that provides affordable, reliable, safe, and increasingly sustainable energy to our nearly 7 million utility customers. Based on early 2020 reporting data, 1,310 investment entities reported owning shares in our company representing around 65% of total shares outstanding. Under SEC proposed changes to the reporting threshold for Form 13F, we estimate that nearly 950 of those 1,310 investment entities would not have been required to report their holdings. Said another way, under the proposed rules, our company would lose information on the identity and positions of 72% of shareholders that are currently required to file under existing rules. Further, changes to the reporting threshold threaten our ability to identify and prepare for potential activist campaigns mounted by short -term -oriented fund managers who may demand that we take measures that may not be consistent with the best interests of our long -term investors. Thus we view proposals, including those made by the SEC, that reduce the level of t ransparency between investors and companies as detrimental to maximizing long -term shareholder value. For the reasons set forth above (as well as those set forth in the letters identified herein), we respectfully ask that the Commission reconsider the implications of this proposed rule amendment and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of 13F disclosure requirements to improve transparency. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, ______________________ James R. Chapman"

We believe that the SE C's proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to cease filing, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly-traded companies in the United States and in a significant increase in short-termism fueled by activist hedge funds. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair our engagement with stockholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist investors that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a small cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 213 of our current 13F filers, representing over 80% of our shares outstand ing (based upon 6/30/2020 13F data) to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter.

Kennedy Blvd, Suite 300 Houston, Texas 77032 Phone: 281.504.4700 www.kraton.com U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission September 21, 2020 Page 2 For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. In addition, we actively engage with our shareholders on a wide variety of topics including corporate governance and strategy. Loss of visibility into ownership of our shares would prevent our ability to continue to conduct this important outreach and shareholder communication. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in companies in our industry or with a similar financial profile) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors in terms of our ability to track conversion to a shareholder. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. J Increased Risk of Activism The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicable"" to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a 1 According to Edelman's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Disclosure -providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions -is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission .... We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicab le regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission September 21, 2020 Page 3 need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus ""gaming the system"" and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company's long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SE C's proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. In the recent past, our company was forced to engage with an activist fund that had taken a position in our stock, and the 13F data was essential to understanding their position and formulating a defense against the short­ term interests of the activists. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent financial planning.""

(NYSE: RVLV), a $1.2 billion market cap company based in Los Angeles, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe the Commission’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to avoid disclosure of their institutional ownership, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to REVOLVE and other publicly traded companies by depriving us and them of timely information about institutional ownership. The proposed rule, if enacted, would also impair engagement with shareholders and impede our ability to attract new long-term investors. Monitoring the investor base is a fundamental and critical activity of a public company, and the inability to identify investors would have negative consequences. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of quarterly ownership information available to REVOLVE and other public companies. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 40 percent of our current 13-F filers to evade disclosure. We do not believe the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on our efforts to regularly communicate with our investors to maximize shareholder value. At REVOLVE we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them since 13F ownership data helps us to efficiently allocate the limited available time of our senior executives for investor communications. As a company aligned with shareholder interests, we strive to maintain active communications with our institutional holders identified via 13F filings data. The 13F data also plays an important role in our investor outreach efforts to target new investors and the proposed amendments would impede our ability to attract new institutional investors and measure the success of our investor outreach. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance. Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the Commission to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the outdated current 45-day reporting period and by requiring the public disclosure of short positions.

The benefits of increased transparency are well documented and greatly outweigh the reporting costs. We should be moving in the opposite direction - we should be increasing transparency, not attempting to hide ownership. I am concerned not only with the ability of activists to ""hide"" their ownership while building stakes - rather, I believe the biggest danger is the ability of undesirable actors to hide stakes in firms and thus engage in nefarious activities. The proposed rule harms investors (especially individuals and small institutions who tend to hold small stakes), firms (who will have to pay a higher cost of capital due to the lower level of transparency and higher risk), and society at large (by favoring criminal actors). It is frankly puzzling that this would even be contemplated, given the overwhelming consensus on the benefits of transparency.

Sadly, that was not the case as he dumped my money into their high commission house funds that performed badly and only lost me money for years. I did not know at the time that they made money regardless if I did and that most of his good advice would be reserved for his large dollar clients. I left thinking it would be easier to bear losing money on my own poor knowledge over paying someone to lose it.Moving on, the internet has recently given more opportunities for small investors to take advantage of SOME of the tools that larger investment firms have had for decades and level the playing field a bit. Small investors use the information from larger investors to help them understand the drastic swings in the market caused by big money. This change would therefore increase corporate ability to manipulate the market and cause havoc for the small investor.Added upon more thoughtThese large investors themselves once were very large and have been able to take advantage of the behavior of larger firms and now they want to take that advantage away from lesser investors trying to scratch out enough money for retirement. This does not seem like a great deal for small investors. ThanksSean MacArthur"

To begin with , the SEC’ s proposal would allow eighty nine percent (89%) of current 13F filers to go dark, result ing in a significant loss of market transparency to DCO and other public ly traded companies in the United States. As a result , the proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with sharehol ders, impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. As you know, 13F filings are currently the only accurate source of ownership information availa ble to DCO as well as other similarly situated U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that identifies the “street name” in which investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. Importantly, this information cannot be ful ly replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. In addition, for small cap companies similar to DCO, the costs of retaining the services of stock surveillance firms would be particularly prohibitive, requiring expenditures of thousands of dollars per month , and as explained further below, place it at a disadvantage when attracting new long -term investors compared to larger issuers. Furthermore, DCO does not believe that the potential impact s of the amendments on our Company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year have been thoroughly evaluated . As a small cap Company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduc tion in 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify and effectively engage with our most active shareholders .

According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021- 22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Since we continue to attract a fair number of hedge fund investors, this would materially limit visibility into our ownership and impact proxy outreach plans in the future. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue th e reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.5 Rather than reduce 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by reducing the archaic 45 -day reporting period and by requiring the public disclosure of short positions. We also encourage the SEC to convene a public roundtable on potential 13F reforms and other market transparency issues, including 13D modernization. 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism -in-the-post-pandemic- market -what -you-need -to-know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepare for post -pandemic activism, ” April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards - can-prepare -post-pandemic -activis m. 5 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for R ulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in O rder to Shorten the R eporting Deadline unde r Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemakin g Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4- 689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4- 691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf .

Reduced Transparency We believe that the Rule Proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States . The transparency provided by the Form 13F reporting regime allows us to effecti vely engage with our shareholders and provides us with an important source of information about activist hedge funds and others that take positions in our securities . Form 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company (as well as other U.S. issuers ) regarding beneficial owners of our stock . We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of the Rule Proposal on our company and the many other companies similarly situa ted to Quest Diagnostics . In the Rule Proposal the Commission has justified the change on the basis that the new threshold would still require Form 13F filings from institutional managers that represent more than 90% of the value of the securities that are currently reported. The Rule Proposal , howeve r, does not adequately address that almost 90% of the current Form 13F filers will no longer be required to report their holdings . For Quest Diagnostics, that “almost 90%” means, practically speaking, a large number of the institutional managers that we h ave or have sought to engage with would no longer have to report holdings on a Form 13F . We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion w ould allow a significant percentage of our 13F filers (currently 55%; has been as high as approximately 60% during 2020) to avoid DocuSign Envelope ID: FC8472A2-D3B2-474A-B5FC-F31DBF8427CF 500 Plaza Drive, Secaucus, New Jersey 07094 QuestDiagnostics.com 2 71681.3 disclosure. We are concerned about how we would be able to identify the many active investment managers, including hedge funds, under the new threshold . Reduced Engagement Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We also use it to target investors as part of our annual investor outreach and engageme nt program. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to allocate time to investors other than our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activi sm. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. We believe the engagement we have with our investors is beneficial to all of our stockholders. The meetings with investors provide our senior executives with unique insights into our industry and the market more generally. We also hear directly about the concerns of investors. Our senior executives share these insights with our Board of Directors and are important to our company . This type of engagement, which we do not believe is unique to Quest Diagnostics, has become a very important investor benefit of the 13F reporting. Negative Impact on Our Ability to Strengthen Our Shareholder Base The loss of 13F data also would imp ede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors in our common stock . Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify long-term shareholders with smaller positions in our stock. We proactively reach out to these investors with smaller positions to speak to these investors about the strengths and strategies of the company in an effort to encourage them to increase their holdings in our company . Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding our common stock each quarter (and the changes from prior quarters) would hinder the ability of our company to continue to strengthen our shareholder base by encouraging long -term investors to increase their positions in our common stock . Increased Risk of Activism Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of ou r company’s long - term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the Rule Proposal potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we take measures that may not be part of our lo ng-term strategy or otherwise not in the interests of our stockholders . Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 % (or often more) position.

If 13F filings can be costly for certain investors, we request the Commission to consider alternatives to address these costs, including alternatives that preserve the transparency of 13F filings. Summary In summary, 13F filings are the primary data source for knowing who shareholders are and t he information they provide is essential for our company. Consistent with the stated interest of the Commission and the investment community, and the strong interest of our company, we engage with our investors, and the 13F filings provide the only reliable means for un derstanding who our shareholders are. Removing nearly 90% of filers would limit our understanding of who our shareholders are and restrict our ability to strengthen the positions of the long -term holders of our common stock. The Rule Proposal could privi lege the voice of larger institutional investors at the expense of smaller ones, and is inconsistent with the dramatic change in issuer -investor engagement in the U.S. equity markets since 1975. For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission reconsider its proposed 13F amendments and pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .1 Rather than reduc e 13F transparency , we urge the Commission to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and shortening the 45-day reporting period .

Given the historical focus on increased shareholder transparency that the Commission ha s previously strongly advocated, the current proposal is a surprising and, we believe, a very negative change in direction. By raising the threshold as proposed in the Current Proposal , there is a significant reduction in the number of institutions that w ould be required to report. By focusing your data on the value of Form 13F reporting, the data is heavily influenced by the largest managers and overlooks the significant number of institutions that would no longer be filing quarterly reports of their hol dings. In the case of our Company, Everi Holdings Inc (NYSE: EVRI) , more than 35% of our institutional shareholders , including several of our very largest shareholders, would no longer be required to report their holdings. That is a loss of visibility to more than 1/3 of our shareholder base. Smaller publicly -traded companies (PTCs) , such as ourselves, have worked diligently and invested significantly in Investor Relations efforts to better communicate with our broad investment base. Various regulations a nd responses by brokerages firms during the past few years have generally narrowed their investment research efforts and the base of companies under their research coverage , particularly as it relates to small PTCs such as Everi . In response, we smaller P TCs have been forced to step up efforts and resources devoted to outreach to shareholders and particularly recruitment of new shareholders. Th e Current Proposal would further severely crimp our investor outreach efforts. 2 Reducing visibility into that br oad and large base of smaller institutional managers may not have much impact on the large -capitalized global companies, but for us smaller PTCs, who are typically far more focused on domestic markets, it can impose a significant new hurdle in requiring significant additional investment in our Investor Relations efforts . Needless to say, our primary focus has been to invest resources to support and pursue corporate initiatives that, particularly in this post -COVID economy, recover and subse quently grow and sustain our business and our employment base . Potentially having to divert limited resources to increase support of investor identification needs is particularly impactful for PTCs of our size . We strongly request the Commission recons ider its current proposal given the disproportionate impact to small - and micro -cap PTCs as well as the overall negative consequences to PTC transparency to their shareholders that are likely to result. As an alternative to the Current Proposal, w e would encourage the Commission to instead take this opportunity to consider shorten ing the timeframe for institutional holders to report holdings. Technology has shortened trading settlement times and improved internal reporting processes such that information is conveyed in nearly real -time, yet the deadline for reporting has remained at 45 days following the end of a fiscal quarter . Again, this type of lag in reporting puts PTCs at a decided disadvantage as it relates to overall investor relation efforts, but also potential corporate strategies and initiatives. We thank you for this opportunity to provide comment to the Current Pr oposal , and hope you will take into consideration our concerns . Sincerely, Michael A. Rumbolz Chief Executive Officer"

(NYSE: OKE) , a leading midstream energy service provider headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and owner of one of the nation’s premier natural gas liquids systems, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. As a publicly traded company included in the S&P 500 , we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts . We believe that the proposed amendments would greatly reduce transparency around holdings , significantly undermine issuer -investor engagement , deprive retail inv estors of information use d to make investment decisions and expose compan ies to a greater risk of activism by short -term-oriented fund managers . We are particularly concerned with how the reduction of market transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow nearly 6 0% of our current 13F filers to avoid disclosu re, including at least one shareholder owning a more than 1% stake in our company . The re is also a negative impact of raising the 13F threshold on retail investors , which account for approximately 30% of ONEOK’s investor base, and small asset managers who use 13F data when making investment decisions. We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure process to improve transparency , as opposed to limit it . The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and this proposal would be a misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency.

Our dual listing on two stock exchanges and in particular our listing in the US has been a critical development for our business. Euronav is the largest quoted crude tanker company in the world and gaining access to US capital markets will continue to be a key requirement for our future development. We are therefore alarmed and disappointed with the SEC proposal to amend quarterly disclosure of equity holdings on Form l 3F and specifically to increasing the disclosure threshold from $1 00 million to $3.5 billion. Whilst we appreciate the SEC's efforts to mitigate administrative costs for institutional investment managers Euronav strongly believe that the reduced transparency resulting from this proposal could be harmful to public companies and investors. The proposal would prevent investors from accessing data for an additional $2.3 trillion worth of assets managed by 4,500 investment managers, and limit issuers' transparency into their constituents and asset bases. l 3Fs also serve as a critical tool to enhance benchmarking, shareholder engagement and other activities that could be impeded if the SEC proposal were adopted. Small-cap issuers like Euronav could be particularly susceptible to a decrease in ownership transparency. Nasdaq estimates that managers in the $1 00 million to $3.5 billion range of reported assets currently allocate l 0% of assets to small and micro-cap companies, equating to 30% of the assets invested in those companies.

(NYSE : SUI) joins ICR LLC (“ICR”) and the National Investor Relations Institute ( “NIRI ”) in opposing the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers.1 W hile we endorse the concept of modernizing 13F reporting , we, like ICR and NIRI, believe that the proposed amendments would have negative consequences . Our views in that regard are set out below. As a path forward, we agree with ICR ’s and NIRI’s suggestions that the Commission withdraw this proposal and re-propose amendments with the reforms described in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .2 More specifically, instead of permitting almost 90% of current 13F filers to stop filing and reducing transparency , the Commission should reduce the reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions and support legislation to provide for more frequent disclosure.3 A s proposed, the current reporting threshold would increase from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe that this change would have a dramatic and negative impact on public companies and the capital markets. To that end, we echo ICR’s and NIRI’s comments as set out in their letter s to the Commission , dated August 25, 2020 and August 26, 20204 respectively, as well as 1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf (the “Proposal”). 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 3 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protectio n Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. We also believe that the Commission should eliminate the ability of beneficial owners of a company to p rohibit their intermed iaries from disclosing their identity to such comp any. 4 See NIRI Letter to the SEC , and ICR’s Letter to the SEC 1 2 Commissioner Lee’s comments in her statement regarding the proposal dated July 10, 2020.5 In addition, we offer the following views regarding the proposal . Significant ly Reduc es Access to Public Information and M arket Transparency If the proposed threshold is adopted, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers or 90% of current 13F filers – representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets – will no longer be required to file Form 13F.6 We understand that the proposed threshold is based on the growth of the U.S. equities mark et between 1975 and December 2018. While the Commission estimates that the increased threshold would retain disclosure for approximately 75% of the dollar va lue of the U.S. equities market , the transparency on that dollar value is greatly different no w given the change in investment strategies since then, i.e., the rise in passive/index invest ing as compared to active investment strategies. Under the proposal, mostly index and passive investing will continue to be reported, which does not provide the same transparency as tracking active and activist investing. Further, the proposed threshold does not reflect the value of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, which would be near $500 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We believe that the proposal , if adopted, will significantly and detrimentally r educe information access and market transparency, which in turn will result in reduced investor confidence and capital market efficiencie s (particularly for smaller capitalization companies) , and further will provide a disincentive for privately owned companies to go public . When Congress first adopted Section 13( f) in 1975, it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the U.S. securities mar kets.”7 However, the current proposal is antithetical to that legislative intent and will have the opposite effect on public companies and our capital markets , the efficiency of and the confidence in which is wholly dependent on information access and transparency . Cloud s Crowding Risk The proposal will create a l ack of clarity regarding crowding risk due to fewer hedge fund manager filings. Investors use 13F filings of top hedge fund managers to understand crowding risk and in turn to appropriately hedge their portfolios. Access to information regarding c rowded positions help investors understand how similar their holdings are to the portfolios managed by institutional managers with similar investment styles/strategies. However, under the proposal , the absence of fewer number s of 13F filings and filers will hinder the ability of inves tors to understand and assess crowding risks, resulting in obscurity and uncertainty for investors , issuers, and the capital markets . Brokers Win, Investors Lose Brokers , not investors, will emerge as winners in the more opaque market most certain to result from the proposal. After the implementation of MiFID II rules, traditional brokers began to los e relevance as investors started to i nvest i n a more direct manner, thereby avoiding broker age 5 See https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee- 13f-reporting -2020 -07- 10 6 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ . 7 See https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf citing Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94 -75 at 78 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 179, 261. See also Division of Investment Management: Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F (May 2005)(Frequently Asked Questions), http://www.sec.gov/divsions /investment/13ffaq.htm, Question 1 at p.1 (“Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States securities markets.”). 2 3 commissions. At the same time, investor re lations officer s started to focus their outreach and capital raising efforts on sponsored research firms/ paid advocates, employees, dealers, vendors and others to actively and directly market their company to and raise capital from investors. However, if the propos al is adopted , companies that currently rely on 13F filings to seek marketing and capital growth insights and opportunities will again become largely dependent on brokers to close the information and engagement gap . In turn, we believe that t his will lead to higher brokerage commissions and ultimately hinder the growth and efficiency of our capital markets . More Expensive Access to More Limited Information for Companies We believe that a ccess to data will be come more limited and more expensive if the proposal is adopted . The Commission stated that the new reporting threshold would retain data “on over 90% of the dollar value of the securities currently reported.”8 However, the information void that will be created by the proposal due to the lack of reporting by over 90% of the current 13F filers will mean that the cost of accessing that previously available information will increase, and those increased costs will ultimately be borne by the public companies seeking ou t that information and in turn borne by investors and the capital markets as a whole . For example, the cost to comp anies that utilize shareholder surveillance services in an effort to obtain timely and detailed data regarding the transaction activity of investment managers will increase, as these service providers currently rely on 13F filings to produce that data . Similarly, companies seeking to obtain a list of their registered shareholders and non- objecting beneficial owners (NOBO) will have more diffic ulty accessing this information due to more limited publicly available data that would result from the proposals and likely will need to pay more for that information as a result. 9 Damages Investor Relations and Ultimately Capital Markets Our investor relations team seek s to “know our customer ,” with the customer in this case being investors and other market participants. If companies do not understand their investors or worse are unable to ascertain who their investors are, companies will be unable to improve disclosures , and better communicate with and otherwise help their investors. Investors and other market participants want companies to provide them with more, and better, information, transparency and communications. Indeed, the efficiency of our capital markets depends on the timely public dissemination of accurate information about issuers and their securities, and the Commission has recently and historically called for more transparency with investors, particularly during times of market uncertainty. Companies will be unable to do that if they are unable to readily identify their investors and evaluate investor activity and behavior. 10 Companies certainly will be unable, or less able , to do that if the proposals are adopted. We believe this will not only negatively impact public companies but the capital markets as a whole , as described below. Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies in which they invest. Investors now engage more directly with issuers on many important matters, including capital allocation decisions, long -term strategy, mergers an d acquisitions , and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to seek to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. 8 See https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152 9 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/Mjk= 10 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/MzE = 3 4 One of the most importa nt duties of our investor relations team is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C -suite executives or directors. Most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available, to properly engage with investors. However, t he Commission’s proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust investor relations engagement that has developed b y excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long -term basis. While companies would continue to receive information from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F d ata from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is more important . Small and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. With out that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. Additional discussion about these topics follows. Harms Retail Investors Retail investors often will place reliance on a company’s 13F data when they make investment decisions. With the proposal, these investors will have far less information with which to make such decisions, and information that would remain available can be deceiving, particularly as it pertains to micro - and small- cap companies. For example, the 13F filings associated with a micro - cap company could make it appear to an investor that the company has no institutional ownership whatsoe ver, when that might not actually be the case. As one investor relations professional recently noted , a significant concern regarding the proposal is a potential degrading of investor trust in the micro/small cap market s. He pointed out that these issuers likely do not have a roster of large ($3.6B and up) institution al investment managers yet: Decreasing transparency for the smaller institutions significantly har ms micro/small caps in their ability to know who’s holding their stock, while giving the impression that they h ave no institutional following. 11 In our view, more and more retail investors are seeking to access the capital markets without the assistance of an intermediary and further seek to invest in “start- ups”, i.e., micro -cap and small cap companies. H arm s the Most Vulnerable Issuers and Investors IHS Markit analyzed the 3000 largest companies in the United States to identify which issuers and investor s would be most affected by the increase of the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion: •In terms of issuers, I HS Markit found that micro -cap, small- cap and energy companies would be most severely affected by the resulting loss of information access , while mega - cap, large -cap and utilities companies would see the least impact. •In terms of in stitutional managers /investors , IHS Markit found that the proposal would noticeably impact alternative /specialty and active/ high turno ver institutional investment 11 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/MzE = 4 5 managers in terms of relief from filing requirements , while index /low turnover managers would see little relief from their filing requirements . On average, 55% of the investors, and 69% of the hedge fund investors, on an issuer’s shareholder list would no longer be the subject of 13F filings. •Importantly, IHS Markit analyzed the impact on “ activist” institutional investment managers and found that an incredible 86% of activist managers would no longer be required to file 13Fs .12 Activists tend to build concentrated position s and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3.5 billion . This could lead to an even greater rise in activist managers, leading to significant disruptions to the capital markets an d to p ublic companies.13 Additional discussion regarding activists follows. Increase s Activism Risks J ust as there is a need for greater transparency on the part of public companies with their investors, a company’s need for ownership data is even greater during times of market volatility and uncertainty, when many activist investors seek to take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion t hreshold, public companies would be unable to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus allowing them to “gam e the system” and use the increased lack of transpa rency for their benefit and to the detriment of the co mpany’s long -term shareholders. T he loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes public compan ies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short- term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that the company eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the company’s long -term strategy or the investment strategy of its long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 97 proxy contests were launched.14 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008- 09), so the timin g of the Commission ’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long - term investors. I n sum, without the 13F data that is available now, companies will not know if an activist manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the 13D disclosure threshold is crossed and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Further, unless and until the 13D requirements are updated to, among other thing s, include directors, activists can mask their holdings until it is too late for the company to defend itself. N egative ly Impact s Capital Formation and Markets T he loss of 13F data also would impede a company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies to effectively access the capital markets, communicate with potential investors and to grow their businesses. Under the propo sed threshold, the loss of transparenc y regarding who is holding as well as buying a company’s equity securities each quarter would hinder the company’s ability to 12 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis 13 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ 14 See https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post -pandemic-corporate - activism 5 6 continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the Commission should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Unli kely Reduction in Cost Burden We understand that the Commission aims to reduce the cost burden and provide relief to smaller managers who are currently subject to 13F reporting.15 According to Commission estimates, the direct compliance costs per manager can range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually and the proposal can result in savings of $68 million to $136 million in addition to savings in ind irect costs related to 13F users front- running or copying advisers’ portfolios.16 However, in our experience, the estimates appear to be quite high . Form 13F filings generally are an automated process for investment managers.17 Accordingly, we echo Commis sioner Lee’s views regarding the cost analysis in the proposal.18 Lack of Regulatory Authority We , like Commission er Lee, question the Commission ’s authority to increase the reporting threshold . The statute itself provides no support for such an increas e, and in fact appears to set a statutory reporting threshold of $100 mil lion, while authorizing the Commission to lower it , not increase it . The proposing release does not address this, and simply concludes that the statute provides the Commission with the authority to increase the threshold. Further, in our view, any use of the exemptive authority in Section 13(f)(3) would be inconsistent with the limitation on the Commission’s au thority in Section 13(f)(1) . In oth er words, the Commission would be using its exemptive authority to turn the statute on its head . Fo r the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35 -times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by ICR, NIR I and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer- investo r engagement.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: File No. S7-08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-89290 (July 10, 2020) Dear Ms. Countryman, On behalf of Castlight Health, Inc. (NYSE: CSLT), a small-cap, publicly-listed company that offers healthcare navigation solutions to large employers and health plans, I appreciate the opportunity to offer feedback on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “Commission”) proposed amendments to the rules governing Form 13F. We appreciate the need and importance of modernizing the rules but would like to register our opposition to the Commission’s proposed changes. As a filer with a market capitalization of approximately $200 million, many of our meaningful institutional shareholders would fall below the newly proposed $3.5 billion filing threshold. While 13F filing timelines are longer than we might desire, the filings provide an accurate source of ownership information which allows us to engage regularly with our shareholders. As a company that deeply values and proactively seeks input from our investors, these rule changes would reduce our ability to identify and effectively engage with shareholders throughout the year. In addition, as a small-cap company, we utilize 13F information to identify institutional investors that may be interested in becoming long-term investors in our company. Because small-cap companies like Castlight Health are often not invited to the large investor conferences organized by banks where investors discover or engage with issuers, we use proactive outreach to institutions whose investment activity aligns with our company’s profile to introduce ourselves. This has generated multiple, long-term investments that benefitted both the investor and our company, ultimately creating a more efficient and effective market. As the Commission holds capital formation as core to its mission, we believe 13F disclosures support companies like ours in accessing capital markets. Given these concerns, and those of other issuers as well as the leading exchanges, we ask that the Commission reconsider its proposed amendments to the rules governing 13F filers. We value modernization but hope that the Commission will consider the perspective of small-cap issuers who benefit from a transparent, open market. Sincerely, Will Bondurant Chief Financial Officer, Castlight Health"

Taylor, Vice President, Listings & Services, NYSE",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7797941-223589.pdf,,"September 21, 2020 Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 RE: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers ; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of NYSE Group, Inc.1 (“NYSE”) and the 381 undersigned publicly traded companies, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on proposed amendments to the reporting threshold for 13F reports by institutional investment managers (the “Proposal” ).2 Today, the NYSE, with its 2,200 listed companies, i s the world’s largest exchange, with total listed company market capitalization of more than $28 trillion, representing approximately 30% of the world’s public market value. The U.S. capital markets provide unparalleled access to capital, liquidity and trusted regulation and are the destination of choice for investors and public companies. NYSE supports balanced regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to support a healthy pipeline of issuers that seek to access the public markets. Balanced regulation, in turn, benefits investors via savings vehicles of all kinds, job growth opportunities for Main Street, and contributes to the growth of the entire U.S. economy. In considering changes to the regulatory regime for 13F reporting, it is critic al for the Commission to preserve the ability for issuers and investors to maintain access to the many benefits that 13F reporting provides. In principle, we support the Commission’s intent to update the regulatory regime applicable to 13F reporting to re flect today’s U.S. marketplace. In practice, however, the Commission’s Proposal is so narrowly focused and one sided that it sets an inevitable policy path toward erosion of transparency for public issuers and investors. The NYSE strenuously objects to t he Proposal in its current form. Background Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act was adopted by Congress as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975.3 The Commission’s 1979 release mandating quarterly (as opposed to annual) Section 13(f) reporting acknowledged the value that 13F data has to the marketplace: 1 NYSE Group submits this letter on behalf of New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE American LLC, NYSE National, Inc. and NYSE Chicago, Inc. 2 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-89290 (July 10, 2020), 85 FR 46016 (July 31, 2020). 3 Pub. L. No. 94 -29, 89 Stat. 97 (1975). Chris T. Taylor Vice President, Listings & Services , NYSE 11 Wall Street New York, NY 10005 T: 212-656-3480 Chris.Taylor@nyse.com 2 The reporting system required by Section 13(f) is intended to create in the Commission a centr al repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers, in order to improve the body of factual data available and to facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investmen t managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence.4 Pursuant to current Rule 13f -1(a)(1), every institutional investment manager who exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding “Section 13(f) s ecurities” having an aggregate fair market value of at least $100,000,000 on the last trading day of any month must file a report on Form 13F.5 Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1 requires investment managers to file reports on Form 13F with the Commission within 45 days after the last day of each calendar quarter. The Commission has recognized the benefits that Rule 13f -1 reporting has for both investors and public issuers . In 1999, when adopting rules requiring the filing of Form 13F via EDGAR, the Commission noted that “investors would find the information contained in Form 13F filings useful in tracking institutional investor holdings in their investments and . . . issuers would find detail as to institutional investor holdings usefu l because much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.”6 Unfortunately, the Proposal in its current form, which raises the reporting threshold from $100 million in 13(f) securities to $3.5 billion , would compromise the benefits that the Commission previously recognized for 13F reporting. The Proposal Erodes Transparency for Issuers and Investors The disclosures attendant to the 13F filing process are designed to provide the Commission, issuers , and the investing public with information to make more informed decisions about how to regulate, engage with shareholders, and invest in public companies. In its current form, t he Proposal limits a ccess to information for public issuers and investors, w hich is the exact opposite direction of where the Commission should be heading. The Proposal’s limitation on transparency is at odds with the Commission’s regulatory agenda in general and with how the Commission itself has explained access to information and its role in facilitating such access: “Only through the steady flow of timely, comprehensive, and accurate information can people make sound investment decisions. The result of this information flow is a far more active, efficient, and transparent ca pital market that facilitates the capital formation to our nation’s economy.” The Proposal sets forth a number of helpful use cases for Form 13F data, a number of which would be compromised if the Commission adopts the Proposal in its current form.7 Of particular note is an external use case that describes how corporate issuers may use Form 13F data for 4 Exchange Act Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5, 1979), 44 FR 3033, at 3033 -3034 (the “1979 Adopting Release”). 5 See Exchange Act Rule 13f -1 (17 C.F.R. 240.13f -1) and Form 13F under the Exchange Act. 6 Exchange Act Release No. 40934 (Jan. 12, 1999), 64 FR 2843, at p. 2844 -45 (the “EDGAR Adopting Release”). 7 See Propo sal at 22. 3 purposes of “determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock.” We could not agree more. The material reduction in information an d ownership transparency that would result from th e Proposal would deliver a debilitating blow for investor relations teams who lead shareholder engagement for public issuers and are in constant search for information regarding the owners of their companie s. Put simply, if an issuer does not know who owns it, how can it properly engage with its owners? There is recent data that supports the importance of Form 13F data to the shareholder engagement efforts of public issuers. Following the publication of the Proposal, IHS Markit conducted a study of investor relations professionals and CFOs at corporate issuers to evaluate their responses to the reduction of information provided through 13F filings.8 The study considered responses from 110 issuers with market capitalizations ranging from $35M to $400B . Of those issuers, 82% of the respondents “Strongly Oppose” the Proposal, 16% “Oppose” the proposal, 1% “Support” the Proposal and 1% do not have an opinion. More than 90% of the respondents said the Proposal, if it went into effect, would have “Extremely negative” or “Negative” impacts on: shareholder interactions; targeting (prospecting) new shareholders; the general understanding of their shareholder base; engaging with shareholders for proxy votes; and monitoring for activist investors. The role of the investor relations officer at corporate issuers has grown in importance as institutional ownership of the U.S. equity markets has grown. Regular and informed communication and access to management teams, all within the rules and subject to Regulation Fair Disclosure, are now best practices at a vast majority of the corporate issuers listed on the NYSE and other U.S. securities exchanges. Form 13F data is a foundational element of the tactical, daily decisions that investor relations profes sionals render every day. The Proposal Disproportionately Impacts Small and Mid -Cap Issuers The Proposal emphasizes (positively) that close to 91% of the dollar value of Form 13F holdings data would be retained if the amendments to the ruleset are adopted . The 89.2% of filers that would fall below the threshold , nearly 9 of every 10 filers , are presented as “being relieved of reporting burdens.” The Proposal fails to consider, in fact does not even mention, the impact that a reduction of Form 13F filers will have on small and mid -size issuers. The table below divides the Russell 3000 into various segments based on market capitalization.9 Moving from the largest companies down to the smallest companies, the negative impact on shareholder visibility increases. The bottom line: small and mid -cap issuers would lose visibility into a higher percentage of their shareholder bases than mega and large -cap issuers. Mega and large -cap companies lose visibility into a high percentage of holders by count, but a relatively lower percentage of shares outstanding and institutional ownership. 8 Available at https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0820/IHS -Markit -Perspectives -Special -Feedback -on- SEC-13-F-Proposal.pdf 9 Source : IHS Markit and FactSe t Research Systems 4 Issuer Market Capitalization % of Shares Outstanding Lost % of Institutional Ownership Lost % of Institutional Holders Lost Mega (>$50B) 4.4% 6.2% 77.2% Large (>$10B) 5.5% 6.4% 60.2% Mid (>$2B) 9.4% 10.3% 46.7% Small (>$200M) 14.6% 17.1% 37.1% Micro (<$200M) 17.1% 31.2% 32.8% On average, small -cap issuers would lose visibility into nearly 15% of their shares outstanding and more than 37% of their institutional holders. Micro -cap issuers are also adversely impacted, losing visibility into more than 17% of shares outstanding and nearly one -third of institutional holders. As the Commission considers the impact of the Proposal, we urge it to consider companies such as Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CNR), which would lose visibility into 73% of its shares outstanding and Container Store Group, Inc. (NYSE:TCS), which would lose visibility into 68% of its s hares outstanding . Reduced visibility into the ownership of their own stock could make these companies more vulnerable to activist shareholders. In addition, r educed visibility into the ownership of sector and fundamental peer companies will greatly inhibit the ability to proactively attract new institutional investment. The Proposal Disadvantages Smaller Institutional Investors If adopted in its current form, the Proposal will disenfranchise smaller institutional investors, the very set of entities that the Commission purports to help through this rulemaking. Form 13F data provides corporate issuers with an understanding of the type, quality and size of an investment manager through the investments reported by 13F filers. Once the Proposal is finalized, the largest and most prominent institutional investors -- who are well -known to corporate issuers -- will continue to make Form 13F filings. However, many of the 4,539 investment managers that would fall under the $3.5B threshold are less well -known or totally unknown to corporate issuers. As corporate issuers work to engage with shareholders, investor relations officers, CFOs and CEOs constantly manage interest from the investment community asking for their time in phone calls or in -person meetings with senior management. The large volume of these requests makes it impossible for a company to accept all invitations and still have time to effectively run its business. As a practical matter, decisions regarding shareholder engagement meetings are made based on the overall nature of the investment manager, typically as determined by the investor relations officer, and almost alw ays based on 13F data . The absence of 13F data will reduce the likelihood for smaller investment managers to engage with corporate management, putting this group at a comparative disadvantage to their larger peers (i.e. those who will remain 13F filers), which could ultimately impair their ability to gather assets and ultimately put their businesses at risk. Smaller managers are already at a disadvantage to the large investment complexes that advertise nationally and have a steady flow of assets linked to S&P 500 and other index funds and ETFs via automatic investment programs, including 401(k)s. We urge the Commission to consider the Proposal’s unintended consequences, in particular, the impact of reduced shareholder engagement for smaller institutions. 5 The Proposal Ignores Modernization of the Timeframe for Filing 13Fs Finally, the Proposal misses the opportunity to update the 13F ruleset in other ways that would benefit both issuers and investors. The NYSE and others have long advocated for modernization of the length of the 45 -day delay period under Rule 13f -1 for submission of data by institutional investor holdings.10 Unfortunately, despite recent initiatives calling for streamlined communication and transparency between public companies a nd investors the Commission has declined to advance rulemaking to address the long overdue deficiencies in the timeframe for reporting Form 13F data. * * * * We encourage the Commission to consider the Proposal in light of the Commission’s broader rulemaking agenda and to strike a balance between transparency for issuers and limiting investor information while continuing to prioritize strong investor protection measures. To that end, the NYSE recommends that the Commission assemble a working group with representation from the issuer community, the investment community and researchers from academia to recommend amendments to Form 13F that are amenable to all affected parties. The NYSE would be happy to assist in the forming of such a group. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposal. Sincerely, Chris T.

(NYSE: NVRO) , a medical device company headquartered in Redwood City, CA , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional invest ment managers. The SEC’s proposal, which would allow almost 90 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long -term investors , and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only source of quarterly ownership information available to our company and other U.S. issuers. While 13F information is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a midcap company listed on the NYSE , we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow a significant number of our current 13F filers to evade disclosure. For our company and Nevro Corp. • 1800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA, USA • 650.251.0005 many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is very valuable .1 2 Engagement Our company also uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests t hat we receive from investors for one- on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers, but also those shareho lders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiv eness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Without this information on who is holding as well as buying our shares each q uarter, our company would be less able to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on public company capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Activism The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, initiate share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of o ur long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021- 22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Our views in that regard are set out below. As a path forward, we agree with ICR's and NIRI's suggestions that the Commission withdraw this proposal and re-propose amendments with the reforms described in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.2 More specifically, instead of permitting almost 90% of current 13F filers to stop filing and reducing transparency, the Commission should reduce the reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions and support legislation to provide for more frequent disclosure.3 1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf (the ""Proposal""). 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2o13/petn4-659.pdf; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-689.pdf.; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/ 2015/petn4-691. pdf. 3 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. We also believe that the Commission should eliminate the ability of beneficial owners of a company to prohibit their intermediaries from disclosing their identity to such company. HARBORSIDE 3 I 210 HUDSON STREET I SUITE 400 I JERSEY CITY, NJ 07311 T: 732.590.1010 WEB: WWW.MACK-CALI.COM As proposed, the current reporting threshold would increase from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe that this change would have a dramatic and negative impact on public companies and the capital markets. To that end, we echo ICR's and NIRI's comments as set out in their letters to the Commission, dated August 25, 2020 and August 26, 20204 respectively, as well as Commissioner Lee's comments in her statement regarding the proposal dated July 10, 2020.s In addition, we offer the following views regarding the proposal. Significantly Reduces Access to Public Information and Market Transparency If the proposed threshold is adopted, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers or 90% of current 13F filers -representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets -will no longer be required to file Form 13F. 6 We understand that the proposed threshold is based on the growth of the U.S. equities market between 1975 and December 2018. While the Commission estimates that the increased threshold would retain disclosure for approximately 75% of the dollar value of the U.S. equities market, the transparency on that dollar value is greatly different now given the change in investment strategies since then, i.e., the rise in passive/index investing as compared to active investment strategies. Under the proposal, mostly index and passive investing will continue to be reported, which does not provide the same transparency as tracking active and activist investing. Further, the proposed threshold does not reflect the value of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, which would be near $500 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We believe that the proposal, if adopted, will significantly and detrimentally reduce information access and market transparency, which in turn will result in reduced investor confidence and capital market efficiencies {particularly for smaller capitalization companies), and further will provide a disincentive for privately owned companies to go public. When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) in 1975, it did so to ""stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.""7 However, the current proposal is antithetical to that legislative intent and will have the opposite effect on public companies and our capital markets, the efficiency of and the confidence in which is wholly dependent on information access and transparency. Clouds Crowding Risk The proposal will create a lack of clarity regarding crowding risk due to fewer hedge fund manager filings. Investors use 13F filings of top hedge fund managers to understand crowding risk and in turn to appropriately hedge their portfolios. Access to information regarding crowded positions help investors understand how similar their holdings are to the portfolios managed by institutional managers with similar investment styles/strategies. However, under the proposal, the absence of fewer numbers of 13F filings and filers will hinder the ability of investors to understand and assess crowding risks, resulting in obscurity and uncertainty for investors, issuers, and the capital markets. 4 See NIRI Letter to the SEC, and ICR's Letter to the SEC s See https://www.sec.gov/news/pub1ic-statement/lee-13f-reporting-202o-o7-10 6 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs-13f-proposal-issuer-and-investor-analysis/. 1 See https://www.sec.gov/files/ 480.pdf citing Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94-75 at 78 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.AN. 179, 261. See also Division oflnvestment Management: Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F (May 2005)(Frequently Asked Questions), http://www.sec.gov/divsions /investment/13ffaq.htm, Question 1 at p.1 (""Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States securities markets.""). 2 Brokers Win, Investors Lose Brokers, not investors, will emerge as winners in the more opaque market most certain to result from the proposal. After the implementation of MiFID II rules, traditional brokers began to lose relevance as investors started to invest in a more direct manner, thereby avoiding brokerage commissions. At the same time, investor relations officers started to focus their outreach and capital raising efforts on sponsored research firms/paid advocates, employees, dealers, vendors and others to actively and directly market their company to and raise capital from investors. However, if the proposal is adopted, companies that currently rely on 13F filings to seek marketing and capital growth insights and opportunities will again become largely dependent on brokers to close the information and engagement gap. In turn, we believe that this will lead to higher brokerage commissions and ultimately hinder the growth and efficiency of our capital markets. More Expensive Access to More Limited Information for Companies We believe that access to data will become more limited and more expensive if the proposal is adopted. The Commission stated that the new reporting threshold would retain data ""on over 90% of the dollar value of the securities currently reported.""8 However, the information void that will be created by the proposal due to the lack of reporting by over 90% of the current 13F filers will mean that the cost of accessing that previously available information will increase, and those increased costs will ultimately be borne by the public companies seeking out that information and in turn borne by investors and the capital markets as a whole. For example, the cost to companies that utilize shareholder surveillance services in an effort to obtain timely and detailed data regarding the transaction activity of investment managers will increase, as these service providers currently rely on 13F filings to produce that data. Similarly, companies seeking to obtain a list of their registered shareholders and non-objecting beneficial owners (NOBO) will have more difficulty accessing this information due to more limited publicly available data that would result from the proposals and likely will need to pay more for that information as a result. 9 Damages Investor Relations and Ultimately Capital Markets Our investor relations team seeks to ""know our customer,"" with the customer in this case being investors and other market participants. If companies do not understand their investors or worse are unable to ascertain who their investors are, companies will be unable to improve disclosures, and better communicate with and otherwise help their investors. Investors and other market participants want companies to provide them with more, and better, information, transparency and communications. Indeed, the efficiency of our capital markets depends on the timely public dissemination of accurate information about issuers and their securities, and the Commission has recently and historically called for more transparency with investors, particularly during times of market uncertainty. Companies will be unable to do that if they are unable to readily identify their investors and evaluate investor activity and behavior.1° Companies certainly will be unable, or less able, to do that if the proposals are adopted. We believe this will not only negatively impact public companies but the capital markets as a whole, as described below. Since the Commission's Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies in which they invest. Investors now engage more directly with issuers on many important matters, 8 See https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-152 9 See https:/ /www.intro-act.com/ # /fundamentals/Mjk= 10 See https://www.intro-act.com/ # /fundamentals/MzE= 3 including capital allocation decisions, long-term strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/ or engaged investor relations professionals to seek to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most important duties of our investor relations team is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C-suite executives or directors. Most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available, to properly engage with investors. However, the Commission's proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust investor relations engagement that has developed by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long-term basis. While companies would continue to receive information from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is more important. Small and mid-cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. Additional discussion about these topics follows. Harms Retail Investors Retail investors often will place reliance on a company's 13F data when they make investment decisions. With the proposal, these investors will have far less information with which to make such decisions, and information that would remain available can be deceiving, particularly as it pertains to micro-and small-cap companies. For example, the 13F filings associated with a micro­ cap company could make it appear to an investor that the company has no institutional ownership whatsoever, when that might not actually be the case. As one investor relations professional recently noted, a significant concern regarding the proposal is a potential degrading of investor trust in the micro/small cap markets. He pointed out that these issuers likely do not have a roster of large ( $3.6B and up) institutional investment managers yet: Decreasing transparency for the smaller institutions significantly harms micro/small caps in their ability to know who's holding their stock, while giving the impression that they have no institutional following.11 In our view, more and more retail investors are seeking to access the capital markets without the assistance of an intermediary and further seek to invest in ""start-ups"", i.e., micro-cap and small cap companies. Harms the Most Vulnerable Issuers and Investors IHS Markit analyzed the 3000 largest companies in the United States to identify which issuers and investors would be most affected by the increase of the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion: 11 See https:/ /www.intro-act.com/ # /fundamentals/MzE= 4 • In terms of issuers, IHS Markit found that micro-cap, small-cap and energy companies would be most severely affected by the resulting loss of information access, while mega­ cap, large-cap and utilities companies would see the least impact. • In terms of institutional managers/investors, IHS Markit found that the proposal would noticeably impact alternative/specialty and active/high turnover institutional investment managers in terms of relief from filing requirements, while index/low turnover managers would see little relief from their filing requirements. On average, 55% of the investors, and 69% of the hedge fund investors, on an issuer's shareholder list would no longer be the subject of 13F filings. • Importantly, IHS Markit analyzed the impact on ""activist"" institutional investment managers and found that an incredible 86% of activist managers would no longer be required to file 13Fs.12 Activists tend to build concentrated positions and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3-5 billion. This could lead to an even greater rise in activist managers, leading to significant disruptions to the capital markets and to public companies.13 Additional discussion regarding activists follows. Increases Activism Risks Just as there is a need for greater transparency on the part of public companies with their investors, a company's need for ownership data is even greater during times of market volatility and uncertainty, when many activist investors seek to take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, public companies would be unable to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus allowing them to ""game the system"" and use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and to the detriment of the company's long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes public companies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that the company eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the company's long-term strategy or the investment strategy of its long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 97 proxy contests were launched.14 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the Commission's proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long­ term investors. In sum, without the 13F data that is available now, companies will not know if an activist manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the 13D disclosure threshold is crossed and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Further, unless and until the 13D requirements are updated to, among other things, include directors, activists can mask their holdings until it is too late for the company to defend itself. Negatively Impacts Capital Formation and Markets 12 See https://ipreo.com/blog/ secs-13f-proposal-issuer-and-investor-analysis 1a See https://ipreo.comjblog/secs-13f-proposal-issuer-and-investor-analysis/ 14 See https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate-governance/insight-preparing-for-post-pandemic-corporate­ activism 5 The loss of 13F data also would impede a company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies to effectively access the capital markets, communicate with potential investors and to grow their businesses. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency regarding who is holding as well as buying a company's equity securities each quarter would hinder the company's ability to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the Commission should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Unlikely Reduction in Cost Burden We understand that the Commission aims to reduce the cost burden and provide relief to smaller managers who are currently subject to 13F reporting.1s According to Commission estimates, the direct compliance costs per manager can range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually and the proposal can result in savings of $68 million to $136 million in addition to savings in indirect costs related to 13F users front-running or copying advisers' portfolios.16 However, in our experience, the estimates appear to be quite high. Form 13F filings generally are an automated process for investment managers.11 Accordingly, we echo Commissioner Lee's views regarding the cost analysis in the proposal. 18 Lack of Regulatory Authority We, like Commissioner Lee, question the Commission's authority to increase the reporting threshold. The statute itself provides no support for such an increase, and in fact appears to set a statutory reporting threshold of $100 million, while authorizing the Commission to lower it, not increase it. The proposing release does not address this, and simply concludes that the statute provides the Commission with the authority to increase the threshold. Further, in our view, any use of the exemptive authority in Section 13(£)(3) would be inconsistent with the limitation on the Commission's authority in Section 13(£)(1). In other words, the Commission would be using its exemptive authority to turn the statute on its head. For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by ICR, NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer-investor engagement.

Rather than allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, I urge the Commission to require at least monthly disclosure, including short positions.1 I echo objections to the subject rulemaking expressed by the Council of Institutional Investors in their letter of September 17, 2020.2 Our concerns about that amendment are threefold: (1) we believe the amendment could reduce, rather than increase, the transparency of market information that may be useful to long-term investors; (2) we believe the Commission presently may not have the legal authority to raise the rule 13f-1 threshold; 4 and (3) we believe the rule 13f-1 threshold may negatively impact investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets. However, as a retail fund investor, I not only want to know what company stocks my fund investment dollars are buying, I also want to know how my funds are voting their proxies. To paraphrase another iQYeVWRU¶V comment, On what planet is less disclosure good for the average investor? Or, as another investor wrote, You are supposed to be protecting investors, not making it easier for billion-dollar hedge funds to manipulate markets. This proposal is a terrible idea and runs directly counter to the principles upon which the SEC was founded. 1 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. 2https://www.cii.org/files/issues_and_advocacy/correspondence/2020/September%2017%202020%20letter%20to%20SEC%20draft%20(final)-AB.pdf 2 The SEC should act to implement my Request to amendment of Title 17, §270.30b1-4, Report of proxy voting record,3 File 4-748.4 Currently, this data is released only once a year in code that cannot be read and compared by most retail investors. When experts with costly databases have examined that data, the results have been troubling.5 In the Internet age, proxy voting information should be disclosed in real-time and in a format that makes comparing the records of multiple funds easy for the average investor. As Justice Kennedy wrote the Citizens United decision: WiWh Whe adYeQW Rf Whe IQWeUQeW« ShaUehRldeUV caQ deWeUmiQe ZheWheU WheiU cRUSRUaWiRQ¶V SRliWical VSeech adYaQceV Whe cRUSRUaWiRQ¶V iQWeUeVW iQ makiQg profits, and citizens can see whether elecWed RfficialV aUe µiQ Whe SRckeW¶ Rf VR-called moneyed interests. Without disclosure, there is no accountability. Please drop or substantially revise the CRmmiVViRQ¶V proposed 13F reporting amendments and act on my petition to require real-time disclosure of proxy votes in a user-friendly sortable format.

If this rule is enacted it will hurt my small business and I'm sure many others. The 13F is a great way to do additional due diligence on possible investment managers. For instance, if I'm interested in investing with a manager but their stated performance is dramatically different than what the 13F would seem to indicate, it creates a reason to dig even deeper into the manager. It also allows me to verify (at least in a small way) their overall performance and to make sure there isn't things like style drift. It also allows me to understand their investment process better so that I can make better decisions. I am very against this change as it makes the market less transparent and will have an adverse effect on small advisory businesses."

Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: File No. S7-08-20 We respectfully submit comments on File No. S7-08-20 in opposition to the proposed changes to Form 13F reporting. We believe that the proposed changes will reduce market transparency and hinder shareholder engagement. Transparency regarding an issuer's shareholder base is critically important for corporate issuers. Increasing the reporting threshold for Section 13(f) securities to $3.5 billion will harmfully reduce the number of investors required to disclose investment positions, thereby reducing an issuer's ability to plan for and conduct engagement with its investors. We continue to experience an increase in requests from investors for engagement on long-term strategy, sustainability, governance, and other important issues. We rely on data in Form 13F reports to determine which institutions own our shares and the size of their positions. Increasing the reporting~hreshold for Form 13F will create a significant impediment to our shareholder engagement efforts because of the significant loss of transparency of our shareholder base. Adoption of the proposed amendments will impede issuers from promptly identifying their investors and thereby hinder shareholder/issuer engagement. For these reasons, we oppose the proposed amendments. Instead of the proposed changes that would reduce market transparency, we respectfully note that we favor reforms that would increase transparency. For example, we favor reforms that (i) would require monthly (rather than quarterly) reporting, (ii) shorten the Form 13 reporting deadline to two business days after month end, and/or (iii) include disclosure of short-sale activities.

"Lynn A. Tyson, Executive Director, Investor Relations, Ford Motor Company",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7794103-223556.pdf,,"September 18, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commiss ion 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 World Headquarters One American Road Dearborn, Ml 48126-2701 USA Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Ford Motor Company, I am writing to respectfully express our opposition to the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. While we welcome the Commission's interest in modernizing 13F reporting, we believe the proposed amendments would create negative impacts that outweigh the benefits. The drawbacks include reducing overall market transparency, introducing selection bias in research, and impairing shareholder engagement. Reduce Market Transparency Increasing the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports from $100 million to $3.S billion would exempt from disclosure more than 4,500 fund managers -or nearly 90% of all filers -who collectively oversee $2.3 trillion in assets. For Ford Motor Company, we would lose visibility on 722 of our shareholde rs, or approximately 68%, that are 13F filers as of June 30, 2020, which we consider to be a significant loss of ·market transparency. This information cannot be fully replaced by offerings from stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as input into their research. Introduce Selection Bias Systematically exempting investors from disclosure introduces selection bias in research and analysis that would otherwise promote efficient markets and an understanding of market mechanisms. The selection bias is evident in the disproportionate impact of the proposed amendments on our shareholder base. If the 13F threshold increased as proposed, we would lose visibility on 5% of the shares held by active-oriented filers and 13% of hedge fund filers, compared to only 1% of the shares held by passive-oriented filers. Impair Shareholder Engagement As a publicly traded company for over 64 years, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts. We believe the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around holdings, significantly undermining issuer-investor engagement and prioritization, including for large-cap companies such as ours. The reduced transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. In particular, we note the rapid developments in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of visibility around shareholder activity would hinder our ability to increase our exposure to this growing area and make it more difficult to measure the effectiveness of our ESG outreach efforts. Based on the drawbacks listed above, we ask that the Commission withdraw this proposal and instead consider modernizing 13F reporting consistent with the more holistic reforms that were detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq.1 The reforms include reducing the 45-day reporting period, requiring 13F filers to disclose short positions, and supporting legislation to provide for monthly disclosure. Effective shareholder engagement is more important than ever, and we believe these alternative actions would add value to shareholders at a time when they are calling for greater transparency. ;J} 1i 6~Jrp1 I ~ Lyn;2tipas Tyson Executive Director, Investor Relations Ford Motor Company Desk: 313-621-2902 I Desk: 914-485-1150 Ltyson4@ford.com shareholder .ford.com 1 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(l) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-659, February 4, 2013, available at: https:ljwww .sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www .sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at https:ljwww.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-691.pdf ."

(NASDAQ: PEIX), a leading producer and marketer of high quality alcohol products and low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s propos al, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would significantly impair engagement with our institutional investors about our business strategy and corporate governance, reduce our ability to attract new investors, deprive us of timely information about activist funds that take significant positions in our stock, and exacerbate short -term pressures on our company at the expense of long- term shareholder value. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the Commission’s arbitrary 35 -times increase in the 13F threshold is not justified by the modest cost savings for investors. The 13F proposal is entirely inconsistent with the measured approach the SEC has applied to economic thresholds in other recent rulemakings, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies , 1 the 1 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33- 10332; 34- 80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017). 2 adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer s tatus ,2 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.3 We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on public companies and their obligation to confer regularly with their investors. As a small- cap company, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow more than 80 percent of our current 13F filers who are active investors to evade disclosure. While our largest investors would continue to disclose, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the $3.5 billion threshold that is far mo re valuable. While 13F data is not as timely as it should or could be, it is only data that U.S. companies have that shows which “s treet name ” investors are buying or selling their s hares each quarter. This data can not be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firm s, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. The loss of this essential 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new investors. Like many other small- cap issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business. The loss of transparency around who is buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should f ully consider the negat ive impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. The loss of 13F data will also expose our company to a gre ater risk of ambush activism by short- term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we slash jobs, reduce research spending, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long- term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly distraction, so many public companies (especially small 2 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34 -88365; File No. S7- 06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold fo r exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 3 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a -8, File No: S7 -23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increas e the minimum economic threshold for shareholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company’s shares for at least three years.) 3 and mid- cap issuers) often conclude that they have no choice but to settle with short- term activists. Market observers expect another surge in proxy fights after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long- term investors . Without the 13F data we receive now , our company will not know if a pack of activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 billion threshold) are plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw th ese proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the common- sense reforms detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. 4 Rather than reduce market transparency, we urge the SEC to modernize 13F by cutting the archaic 45 -day reporting period, requir ing the public disclosure of short positions, and support ing monthly disclosure by 13F filers .

Reduc tion of Transparency Commissioner Allison Herren Lee has stated that the Proposed Rule would reduce transparency by eliminating “ access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 tril lion in assets .”5 CII membership approved policies support disclosure by institutional investor s of fund holdings.6 More generally, our policies support disclosure of material market information that improve s, rather than reduce s, transparency to long -term institutional investors.7 Those policies, also include criteria that could potentially lead us to support a proposal, like the Proposed Rule, that reduces transparency if, for example, the proposal otherwi se provides a net benefit to long-term institut ional investors.8 We note the SEC’s stated belief that the Proposed Rule would likely “enhance competition by lowering the costs to participate in the market ” and benefit investors if such savings are passed through to investors.9 That potential benefit to investors from this and other aspects of the Proposed Rule , however, may potentially be offset or outweighed by the loss of transparency that could result from the Proposed Rule. For example, Commissioner Lee has suggested that adoption of the Proposed Rule could have costs for investors because “there is a recognition that new uses of the data have developed among academics, market researchers, and others, . . . and the costs to the Commission . . . of losing a portion of the data .”10 And at least one provider of hedge fund stock ownership data has asserted that the Proposed Rule would reduce the ability of “pension funds and other institutional the last day of such calendar year and within 45 days after the last day of each of the first three calendar quarters of the subsequent calendar year.”) . 5 Commissioner Allison Herren Lee . 6 See Council of Institutional Investors, Policies on Other Issues, Best Disclosure Practices for Institutional Investors (Adopted May 1, 2009), https://www.cii.org/policies_other_issues#disclosure_practices_inst_invest (“In order to foster an environment of transparency and accountability, institutional investors —including pension funds, hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, among others —should make publicly available in a timely manner: . . . an annual report on holdings . . . .”). 7 See Council of Institutional Investors, Policies on Other Issues, Statemen t on Company Disclosure (Adopted Mar. 10, 2020 ) (“In evaluating proposals . . .

As Commissioner Lee has explained: The enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold. To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports w ith the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. (emphasi s added) The text is clear: Congress set a statutory reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it. The proposing release does not wrestle with this language at all, and asserts uncritically that Section 13(f)(1) pr ovides us with the relevant authority. Congress appears to have said otherwise, setting specific limits on the Commission’s authority in that respect.14 Commissioner Lee’s conclusion is supported by an analysis by Alex Platt, an associate professor at the University of Kansas School of Law .15 Professor Platt directly refutes a key argument in the 11 Novus Editorial, Andrea Gentilini & Nathan Innis, Don’t Mess with 13Fs, No vus (July 22, 2020), https://www.novus.com/blog/dont -mess -with-13fs. 12 Commissioner Alliso n Herren Lee (“There is also very little discussion of the costs . . . of losing a portion of the data.”). 13 See Lara Crigger , Legal Questions Circle SEC’s 13F Plan, ETF.Com (Sept. 10, 2020), https://www.etf.com/sections/features -and-news/legal -questions -circle -secs-13f-plan?nopaging=1 (“Does the SEC have the legal authority to raise the 13F reporting threshold?

Page 4 of 5 September 17, 2020 Proposed Rule that a 1975 Senate Banking Committee report gives the Commission “authority to raise or lower ” 16 the threshold.17 As Professor Platt explains: [The 1975 Senate Banking Committee report language ] never became law. Shortly after the Senate passed this bill, the House passed a different version requiring the SEC set the reporting threshold at “at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000)….” . . . . . . . . After the House passed this version, a Conference Committee was convened and . . . [a] s enacted – and to this day – the operative statutory threshold is “$100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000)….” In sum, the Commission’s legal theory for why its proposal is authorized under § 13(f) seems to rely on a misinterpretation of the statute’s legislative history. . . . [T]he 1975 Congress rejected language . . . that would have authorized the SEC to raise the reporting threshold in favor of language (“such lesser amount”) that seems to preclude this.18 Impact on Investor Confidence The Proposed Rule describes as one of the SEC’s original “primary goals [of section 13(f) disclosure s was] to increase investor confidence in the integ rity of the U.S. securities markets.”19 CII membership approved policies describe the crisis of investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets following the global financial crisis .20 Our policies reflect th e view that transparency ,21 including public reporting,22 and the vigilance and oversight of regulators, including the SEC,23 are critical factors to creating and maintaining investor confidence in our markets. As previously indica ted, we believe the Proposed Rule could have at least two undesirable results that may be inconsistent with the primary goal of section 13(f) to increase investor confidence in 16 85 Fed. Reg. at 46,018 (“The 1975 Amendments Senate Report stated that the Commission would ‘have authority to raise or lower ’ the threshold.”). 17 See Notice & Comment . 18 Id. 19 85 Fed.

First, the Proposed Rule could reduce the transparency of disclosures about institutional investor holdings in a manner may have a net cost for long -term institutional investors. And second, the dubious analysis and conclusion that the Commission has the legal authority to raise the 13f -1 filing threshold raises questions about the underlying basis of the Proposed Rule . **** For all of the above reasons, CII cannot support the Proposed Ru le.

Attention: Vanessa Countryman , Secretary September 16, 2020 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers - File No. S7- 08-20 Ladies and Gentlemen: We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission’ s (the “Commission ”) proposed Reporting Threshold for Instituti onal Investment Managers. Herein we provide comments and analysis relating primarily to the Request for Comments in Sections II.D III.B of the proposed rule (“Proposal”) . Part I of this letter provides comment on the central premise of the Proposal. The Commission estimates that the Proposal would exempt 89% of institutional investors from filing Form 13F (“affected filers”) and provide an average annual cost saving s of approximately $21,000 per affected filer. These cost saving s are economically small in that they amount to 0.004% (0.008% ) of assets under management for the average ( median ) affected filer , and 0.02% of assets for the smallest filer . This small cost savings needs to be weighed against the potentially large costs to investors and others created by eliminating a public disclosure that they heavily use. Part II of this letter comments on various aspects of Section II of the Proposal, “Discussion and Economic Analysis.” We believe the analysis in Section II is incomplete for two reasons. First, the Proposal does not contain any formal economic analysis, and does not attempt to quantify either the extent of use of Form 13F or the benefit s that it provides to investors and other stakeholders. To help fill this void, we analyze the usage pat terns of the EDGAR system, and specifically the frequency of Form 13F downloads from EDGAR . Our analysis reveals that Form 13F is the 6th most highly downloaded form . The most frequently downloaded forms are (in descending order): Form 4, Form 8-K, Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, Schedule 13G, and Form 13F, followed by all other types of forms (e.g., Form S-1 and Form DEF14A ). Our analysis reveals that b etween January 2003 and June 2017, there were 289 million downloads of Form 13F from the EDGAR system . Of these, 87.7% , i.e., 253 million downloads , pertain to affected filers . To put these number s in perspective, the total downloads of all IPO prospectus es, i.e., Form S -1, during the same period was only 104 million . Thus , the demand for affected filers’ Form s 13F was more than twice the demand for all IPO prospectus es from January 2003 to June 2017. Our analysis suggests the investing public and other stakeholders are strongly interested in the information in Form 13F filings , particularly those of affected filers , and that e xempting such institutions from filing Form 13F would deprive the market of this information. 2 Please feel free to contact Professor Daniel Taylor ( dtayl@wharton.upenn.edu ) if you have any questions about this letter or our associated analysis. Sincerely, Mary Barth Graduate School of Business Stanford University Travis Dyer SC Johnson College of Business Cornell University Wayne Landsman Kenan -Flagler Business School University of North Carolina Daniel Taylor The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 3 Part I . Comments on the Proposal’s Central Premise A central premise underlying the Commission’s proposal is that elimination of the Form 13F filing requirement for institutional investors managing investments totaling less than $350 billion in fair market value, (hereafter “affected filers”) will reduce compliance costs and encourage capital investments that otherwise would not be made, without materially affect ing the ability of investors to make informed investment decisions. I.A Economic Significance of the Cost Savings Regarding the reduced compliance costs, the analysis in the Proposal suggests an ave rage annual cost savings of approximately $21,000 per year for affected filers (Proposal, Table 2). The Proposal concludes that such cost s represent a reporting burden. To analyze the economic significance of these costs, similar to the Proposal, we analyze all Form 13F filings for the year ended 2018 and calculate the value of investments under management for each filer. We estimate that 89.4% of filers will be affected , which is similar to the estimate of 89.2% in the Proposal . Under present SEC rules, only filers with more than $100 million under management are required to file Form 13F . Our analysis reveals that a ffected filers have a mean (median ) of $527 ($250) million of assets under management . Thus , for the mean (median ) affected filer, the cost savings is approximately 0.004% (0.008%) of assets under management, and for the smallest affected filers, the cost savings is only 0.02% of assets under management .1 Hence, f or virtually all affected filers , the cost savings is economically small and is unlikely to affect their investment decisions or the decision whether to grow their business beyond the $100 million assets under management threshold and become subject to the current Form 13F reporting requirements . I.B Economic Significance of the Cost Savings ––Indirect Costs In addition to compliance costs, the Proposal suggests there are indirect cost s of filing Form 13F , i.e., revealing proprietary information about investment strategy that exposes institutions to “ the potential for front -running and copy catting” (p. 19, hereafter “proprietary costs”) . The P roposal does not quantify thes e proprietary costs. Our analysis suggests that these costs also are economically small. Under current SEC rules, filers can request confidential treatment of information in Form 13F, i.e., redaction of information. If the proprietary costs associated wi th Form 13F were economically large, we would expect institutions to request confidential treatment . Indeed, the Proposal cites academic studies that suggest that redaction of information in Form 13F allows filers to avoid these costs.2 The Proposal does not contain an analysis of redact ions of information in Form 13F . Our analysis of Forms 13F filed during 2018 and 2019 suggests that only 3.7% of affected filers 1 0.004% = 21,000 / 527,000,000; 0.008% = 21,000 / 250,000,000; 0.02% = 21,000 / 100,000,000. 2 See George O. Aragon, Michael Herzel, and Zhen Shi, Why Do Hedge Funds Avoid Dis closure? Evidence from Confidential 13F Filings , 48 J ournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis , 1499 (Oct. 2013); see also Agarwal Vikas, Wei Jiang, Yuehua Tang, and Baozhong Yang, Uncovering Hedge Fund Skill from the Portfolio Holdings They Hide, 68 Journal of Finance 739 (2013). 4 redact ed information . The fact t hat 96.3% did not redact information suggests that for the vast majority of affected filers , Form 13F does not contain propriety information. On p. 14, t he Proposal states that these costs may be larger for affected filers : Form 13F data of smaller managers may be more likely to be used by other market participants to engage in behavior that is damaging to the manager and the beneficial owners of the managed portfolio, such as front running (which primarily harms the beneficial owners) or copycatting (which potentially harms the portfolio manager) , which may increase the costs of investing for smaller managers and hinder their investment performance. However, the Proposal provides no evidence in support of this statement . In addition, as we noted previously, m anagers can avoid these costs by requesting confidential treatment of information in Form 13F. Our analysis of Forms 13F filed during 2018 and 2019 indicates that affected and non - affected filers redact information at similar rates , i.e., 3.7% and 3.2% . The similarity in redaction rates is inconsistent with proprietary costs being disproportionately larger for affected filers. Part II. Comments on the Proposal’s Analysis Evidence -based policy making necessitates that policy maker s consider a cost -benefit tradeoff . Consequently , we encour age the Commission to weigh the benefit of the estimated annual cost savings of $21,000 per affected filer against the cost to investors and stakeholders of not having access to the information . Unfortunately, the Proposal does not quantify either the exte nt of use of Form 13F or the benefits that it provides to investors and other stakeholders . Academic research suggests one way to measure the extent to which the investing public uses the information in Form 13F is to measure the frequency with which such Forms are downloaded from the EDGAR system .3 We begin our analysis in January 2003 and end it in June 2017 because this is the period during which EDGAR download information is publicly available.4 We begin our analysis by measuring the total downloa ds of all SEC forms on EDGAR. We then rank forms based on the frequency of downloads. Figure 1 presents the number of downloads of the top 15 most frequently downloaded forms . Form 4 is the most frequently downloaded, with just over 4 billion downloads. Form 13F is the sixth most frequently downloaded, with approximately 289 million downloads. 3 In examining download statistics from EDGAR it is important to keep in mind they represent a lower bound on use , i.e., the statistics do not include downloads or view s by third -party aggregators such as Bloomberg or Yahoo! Finance . In addition, some downloads undoubtedly are conducted by webscrapers that collect data hosted on third- party websites and for other purposes. Our statistics include such downloads because such downloads represent use of the information in the Form . 4 https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/edgar -log-file-data-set.html 5 Figure 1. Patterns in EDGAR Usage from 20 03-2017: Downloads by Form Next, we identify the Central Index Key of Form 13F filers with less than $3.5 billion in assets under management , i.e., affected filers , and with more than $3.5 billion in assets under manage ment , i.e., non- affected filers . We estimate that 89.4% of filers will be affected, which is similar to the estimate of 89.2% in the Proposal . We then calculate the number of downloads of Forms 13F separately for affected and non- affected filers. Figure 2 presents Form 13F downloads separately for these two groups of filers for two periods: (a) from January 2003 to June 2017 and (b) for the twelve months ending in June 2017. This figure provide s evidence o f the demand for information in Form 13F and the extent to which it is attributable to affected and non -affected filers. Figure 2. Patterns in EDGAR Usage: Form 13F Downloads (a) 2003 to 2017 (b) 12 months ended June 2017 6 Figure 2 shows that of the 289 million Form 13F downloads, 87.7% , i.e., 253 million, pertain to the filings of affected filers. To put this in perspective, the downloads of affected filers’ Form 13F (253 million) is more than double the downloads of all IPO prospectuses between 2003 and 2017, i.e., Form S -1 (104 million). Figure 3 shows that affected filers constitute a greater percentage of all Form 13F downloads in the most recent publicly available 12- month period, 93.6% . Thus, although affected filers are much smaller than non -affected filers, in the most recent period, the demand for their filings is more than ten times tha t of non- affected filers. Thus, the Proposal ’s state ment (p. 24): “We believe that the investing public specifically would be less concerned about the availability of portfolio holdings of these smaller managers” is contradicted by an analysis of EDGAR usage patterns . An analysis of EDGAR downloads suggest s the investing public is considerably more interested in the information in Form 13F of affected filers than that in Form 13F of non- affected filers, 253 versus 58 million downloads , and in the information in Form S -1, 104 million downloads . Collec tively, our analysis suggests the investing public and other stakeholders are strongly interested in the information in Form 13F filings, particularly those of affected filers, and that exempting such institutions from filing Form 13F would deprive the market of this information."

As a consequence of our experience, we believe that the need for increased transparency for investors outweighs concerns related to any administrative burden caused by the 13F filing requirements. In fact, many of our investors, recognizing the long period of lag before the 13F disclosures are made public, have often commented t hat the Form 13F should be expanded to include all positions, including short positions to improve transparency.

(NYSE: RPM), a diversified company headquartered in Medina, Ohio, with subsidiaries that are world leaders in specialty coatings, sealants, building materials and related services, I am writing to express our strong opposition to the Commission's proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers . We believe that the Commission's proposal, which would allow nearly 90 percent of current Form 13F filers to avoid reporting, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to publicly traded companies and their investors. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair our engagement with stockholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us and the public of timely information about ownership positions taken by activist hedge funds. Furthermore, without such reporting, activist hedge funds could be empowered to make unsubstantiated claims about their ownership positions in an attempt to advance the activists' own agendas at target companies. Form 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to us and other U.S. issuers. While Form 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, who themselves rely on quarterly Form 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this Form 13F proposal to our company and many others like us who regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. We are particularly concerned about how the reduction of Form 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active stockholders and engage effectively with them. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is Form 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds (who would most likely no longer be reporting under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold) that is more valuable.1 Our company uses Form 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We try to give priority not only to our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also to those stockholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With the proposed 35-fold increase in the Form 13F threshold, we would have far less insight into how to prioritize our time among such investors. Also, we generally solicit feedback from our stockholders, but our ability to do so would be severely impaired if we no longer have the Form 13F data that helps us know who our stockholders are in the first place. The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce Form 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the Commission that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicable"" to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic. 2 Just as we are expected to provide transparency to our investors, we expect disclosure of ownership data for our large investors, and our need for it is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company's long-term stockholders. The loss of Form 13 F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we 1 According to Edelman's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism after the pandemic subsides, so the timing of the Commission's proposed reduction of Form 13 F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and their long-term investors.4 We believe that the negative impacts of this Form 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our stockholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists, far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the Form 13F threshold is entirely inconsistent with the incremental approach the Commission has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission's inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to Commission's rules on stockholder resolutions. 7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed Form 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post-Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw .com/corporate-governance /insight-prepar ing-for-posl-pandemic-corporat e­ activism. 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post-Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/ 12/activisrn-in-the-post-pandem ic-market-what-you-ne ed-to-know/; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary, ""How boards can prepare for post-pandemic activism,"" April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com /articles/boardroom /32040/how-boards ­ can-prepare-post-pandem ic-activism . 5 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33- 10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-l 6 (March 31, 2017). 6 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-l 9 (March 12, 2020) (the Commission increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 7 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, File No: S7-23-l 9 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increase the minimum holding requirement for stockholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company's shares for at least three years.) 3 and Nasdaq.8 Rather than reduce Form 13F transparency, we urge the Commission to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and reducing the 45-day reporting period.

We urge the SEC to reconsider implementing this proposed rule change and instead require more frequent disclosures and lowering the threshold for reporting to $25 million in assets under management. As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13 F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts -as it is the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around holdings and significantly undermine our investor engagement efforts. The SEC proposal will reduce transparency by raising the $100 million assets under management threshold to $3.5 billion. The potential impact to market transparency and the investor relations function cannot be understated: • The data submitted within 13F filings represents the only accurate source of institutional investor holdings available to public companies. Without this data, public companies \Vould face a significant loss in market transparency into their holders. • Approximately 90% or 4,500 of the current estimated 5,000 l 3F filers would no longer be required to disclose holdings on Form 13F, leaving only 500 of the largest fund managers to provide this important information to the market, severely limiting transparency and creating a disadvantage to the largest holders. • The reduction in the number of filers will likely have a disproportionate impact on smaller public companies as lower float and trading liquidity of smatl caps makes them less attractive to larger institutional managers. • A reduction in an issuer's knowledge regarding the shareholder base will make allocating management time and scarce investor relations resources more difficult.

(603) 893-9701 WWW.STAN DEX.COM • Lack of transparency regarding public companies' shareholder bases will make proxy issues more difficult to address and place companies at a disadvantage when it comes to shareholder activism. The impact of this proposed change seems incongruent with the SEC's m1ss1on to '·protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.'' We also fail to sec how eliminating 90% of the public disclosure of holding by institutions furthers the SEC's vision to ""promote capital markets that inspire public confidence and provide a diverse array of financial opportunities to retail and institutional investors, entrepreneurs, public companies, and other market participants.''1 The significant decrease in oversight and disclosure of the proposed rule change seems antithetical to the mission of the SEC in that less information and transparency damages public confidence in the markets. We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposed rule change and instead implement reforms designed to increase market transparency, such as those detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.2 The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and this proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency and governance ..

The Joint develops, owns, operates, supports, an d manages chiropractic c linics through direct ownership and franchising throughout the United Stat es and is headquartered in Scottsdale, AZ. Of The Joint’s 105 institutional investors, the SEC’s proposal would require only Vanguard, a passive index fund, to file a 13F . We believe that would significan tly impair engagement with our institutional investors about our business strategy and cor porate governance, reduce our ability to attract new investors, deprive us of timely informati on about activist funds that take significant positions in our stock, and exacerbate short-term pressures on our company at the expense of long-term shareholder value. We do not believe that the Commission has adequate ly considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on public companies and their obligati on to confer regularly with their investors. As a $240 million market cap company, we are pa rticularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to id entify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. While 13F data is not as timely it could be, it is the only data that U.S. companies have that shows in which “street name” inve stors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance fi rms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. The loss of this essential 13F data also woul d impede our company’s ability to attract new investors. Like many other small-cap issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential 2 shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach effort s to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business. The loss of transparency around who is buying our shares ea ch quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to raise growth capital . As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the negative impact on cap ital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. The loss of 13F data will also expose our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short- term-oriented fund managers, who may dema nd that we slash j obs, reduce corporate development spending, increase shar e buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long-term investors. Proxy contes ts can be a costly distraction, so many public companies (especially small and mid-cap issuers) often conclude that they have no choice but to settle with short-term activists. Market observers expect an other surge in proxy fights after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides (as ther e was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for affected companies and their long-term investors. Without the 13F data we receiv e now, our company would not know if activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 bill ion threshold) are pla nning a proxy contest until 10 days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclo sure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw these proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the common-sens e reforms detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.1 Rather than reduce market tr ansparency, we urge the SEC to modernize 13F by cutting the archaic 45-day reporting period, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and s upporting monthly disclo sure by 13F filers.

(“Zynerba”), a publicly traded clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Devon, Pennsylvania, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers, as well as Zynerba’s endorsement of the comment letter submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI). We join with the NASDAQ and NIRI, among others, in the belief that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company, as well as to other publicly traded companies in the United States. As stated in the NIRI comment letter, it would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers, in general, to go dark. The proposed rule would result in a similar impact across the biopharmaceutical sector . According to an analysis conducted on Zynerba’s behalf by its IR and capital markets adviso ry firm, Westwicke, on July 17, 2020, of the 5,961 firms with an ownership interest in biopharmaceutical companies as of March 31, 2020, 87% would not be required to file a 13F under the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules . Using Zynerba as a specific example further clarifies the significance of the potential reduced market transparency on small and micro -cap biopharmaceutical companies. As of August 6, 2020, Zynerba ha d 29.3M shares of common stock outstanding. Of those, 8.4M shares ( per 6/30/20 13F data) are held by 1 07 institutional holders who are currently required to file. If the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion were to be finalized, only one institution holding 0.9M shares of our common stock would be required to file . There is no existing remedy to such a drastic loss of market transparency. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company, as well as other U.S. issuers, and no sufficient alternatives exist. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data available that identifies which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. 80 W. Lancaster Avenue, Suite 300| Devon, PA 19333 | 484 -581-7505 | www.zynerba.com This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms and using stock surveil lance tools for several reasons. First, stock surveillance tools, which are used to estimate who may be buying or selling a company’s outstanding shares, often incorporate inaccurate data, which must always be confirmed by 13F data. Without robust quarte rly 13F data to rely upon for these confirmatory checks, the utility of such tools will be greatly diminished. Further, stock surveillance data alone does not enable companies to understand buying and selling in the broader markets or in relevant sectors, geographies, and peer groups. Finally, stock surveillance is cost -prohibitive; most micro - to small -cap companies do not purchase those data due to budget constraints. The potential loss of market transparency associated with the proposed amendments to t he Form 13F reporting rule would not be without consequence. If enacted, companies like ours will suffer detrimental impacts in the form of impaired engagement with shareholders and an increased risk for “ambush activism.” The backdrop of the ongoing glo bal COVID -19 pandemic makes these potential impacts even more troubling. With respect to engagement with shareholders, we do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. We note that this obligation has only increased in the midst of the pandemic and that the Commission has urged public companies to “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by COVID -19. 1 We are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders, engage effectively with them and conduct effective investor intelligence. We rely on quarterly 13F filing data to target i nvestors for meetings and calls and base those decisions on a variety of screens performed on those data to determine (i) who owns/buys/sells our peers, (ii) what institutions are investing in our sector and companies in our geography, and (iii) what insti tutions are investing in companies doing work in similar areas of research. All of these data come from 13F filings, which are the only source available for such information. The Commission’s proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust enga gement we require for our business by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure, including a number of well -known hedge funds who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. 1 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncerta inty.

Lancaster Avenue, Suite 300| Devon, PA 19333 | 484 -581-7505 | www.zynerba.com Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we reduce research funding , alter the clinical targets we are pursuing, or take other measures that may not be part of our long- term strategy or the investment strategy of our long- term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 2 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021- 22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be es pecially unfortunate for companies and long- term investors.3 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Accordingly, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who may “game the system” and use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit, contrary to that of our company’s long- term shareholders. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the potential negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with ou r shareholders and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35- fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic t hresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation- based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies, 4 the 2 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""I nsight : Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post-pandemic -corporate- activism . 3 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Acti vism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism -in-the-post-pandemic -mark et-what -you-need-to-know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary, “How boards can prepare for post -pandemic activism, ” April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards -can-prepare- post-pandemic - activism . 4 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33 -10332; 34-80355; File No. S7- 09-16 (March 31, 2017). 80 W.

And to be able to see what percentage of the pro's portfolio went to that stock ... and at what price ... that's an incredible benefit to the little guy that the SEC is hoping to serve.Millions of small investors are becoming financially literate because of a revolution of financial information disclosure on the internet. Please do not remove one of the little guy's best sources of information about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing.Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the pro investors we follow - great investors who intentionally limit the size of their investment portolios - pros like Guy Spier, Mohnesh Pabrai and Allan Meecham, all of whom will be excused from filing by this change. We rely on small institutional investors for the best sort of guidance in the stock market and would sorely miss this information.As an indication of how beloved these filings are, entire websites are dedicated to these 13f filings like Gurufocus.com, Dataroma.com and WhaleWisdom.com. Gurufocus.com alone has over 500,000 unique visitors a month seeking this information.In the 1970's when this regulation was put in effect, the purpose was to disclose portfolios that could move the market to the benefit of other large investors. Today, things have changed. The little guy is looking for more disclosure, not less. Now this data is also used by millions of small investors to improve their investing results. The 13f data for portfolios between $100 million and $3.5 billion is the sweet spot for small investors and we hope you will see the value in keeping this requirement in place.Warmest regards,Derek Clarke"

The SEC ’s proposal, which would allow almost 90 pe rcent of cu rrent 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significan t loss of market transp arency to o ur company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed r ule, if enacted , would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term inves tors, and deprive us of timely information about activist h edge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only source of quarterly ownership information available to our company and other U.S. issuers. While 13F information is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adeq uately considered th e potentia l impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a small cap comp any of approximately $600 million , we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would im pair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectivel y with them. We estim ate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow appro ximately 20 percent of our current 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investo rs would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders wi th position s that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billi on threshold that is more valuable.1 2 Engagement Our company also uses 13F data to allocate th e limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We try to give priority to not only our largest i nvestors and fund managers with a tr ack record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed incr ease in the 13F threshold, we woul d not have visibility into this important group. Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long‐term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Without this information on who is holding, as well as buying, our shares each quarter, our company would be less able to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on public company capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Activism The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take ot her measures that may not be part of our long- term strategy or the investment strategy of our l ong-term investors.

I am writing to provide comment to the Securities and Exchange Commission on File No. S7-08-20, the Commission’s proposed rule to amend the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers. Stanley Black and Decker is a manufacturing company that has provided tools and innovative solutions for over 175 years. The company is the combination of businesses started in Connecticut (Stanley) and Maryland (Black & Decker) that together have hundreds of years of experience providing the builders, makers and protectors of the world with innovative products across a family of iconic brands. Stanley Black and Decker trades on the New York Stock Exchange, and has a long track record of shareholder return, which includes 144 years of consecutive dividend payments to our shareholders. As a publicly traded company, we value engagement with our shareholders. Investor outreach—to both current and potential shareholders—is vital to the success of any public company, including Stanley Black and Decker. We are entering an era where shareholders desire deeper and more frequent dialog on not just the business, but on environmental, social and governance topics on an ongoing basis. It has never been more critical that businesses have accurate and timely information on their shareholders to foster effective and open communication throughout the year. Form 13F is the only reliable way for public companies to access information about their shareholders. Despite the delays intrinsic to the 13F reporting schedule, the data from Form 13F is the best shareholder information available to Stanley Black and Decker. The information provided about asset managers’ holdings via Form 13F allows Stanley Black and Decker to meaningfully engage, communicate with and educate our shareholders.

The company can make more informed and better decisions when we understand shareholder goals and concerns, and more effectively conduct these critical investor relations and good governance functions. The proposed change to Form 13F will reduce Stanley Black and Decker’s ability to determine and communicate with many of our investors. Exempting 89% of current 13F filers from the reporting requirement would significantly undermine t he vital investor relations functions that 13F data currently supports. This change would also draw management time and cost toward identifying who makes up our shareholder base. Stanley Black and Decker, as a company, is also concerned about the reduction in transparency the proposed changed to Form 13F could effectuate. As such, Stanley Black and Decker strongly encourages the SEC to reconsider the proposed amendments to the reporting threshold for Form 13F. As an issuer, maintaining our company’s current access to shareholder information via Form 13F will allow for the vital shareholder engagement efforts that support America’s thriving capital markets.

Countryman Secretary United States Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: File Number S7 -08-20 Proposed Amendments to Form 13F Dear Ms. Countryman: The Closed -End Fund Association (CEFA) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Commission’s recent proposed rule amendments to Form 13F, the report form for institutional investment managers. CEFA is the nat ional trade association representing the closed- end fund industry. A not - for-profit association, CEFA is committed to educating investors about the many benefits of these unique investment products and to providing a resource for information about its memb ers and their offerings. CEFA members are among the leading investment companies in the United States, Canada and abroad, who have established reputations for their long -term service to shareholders. Together, CEFA and its members are committed to fostering awareness, understanding and responsiveness in serving the needs of the millions of investors who use closed- end funds as core investments to reach their long -term investment goals. Through education and other services, CEFA provides members, investors and advisers with opportunities to share ideas, experiences and information concerning critical issues facing closed -end investment companies. It also serves as an independent vehicle through which CEFA members can express their views on matters of concern . 2345 Grand Boulevard, Suite 1750 | Kansas City, MO 64108 | 816.413.8900 | CEFA .com I. Introduction CEFA welcome d recent steps taken by the Commission and its staff to modify rules and interpretations that have placed unnecessary burdens on closed- end funds. In particular, CEFA members were pleased with the Commission’s decision to provide closed- end funds with greater flexibility to offer shares under shelf registrations. CEFA also was pleased that the Commission staff has withdrawn the 2010 Boulder Total Return Fund letter and taken a more balanced view towards closed- end fund shareholder proposals . CEFA supports two of the proposed changes to Form 13F. In addition to raising the reporting threshold, the proposed amendments would eliminate the omission threshold for Form 13F that currently allows an investment manager to omit holdings of fewer than 10,000 shares in a specific 13(f) Security or less than $200,000 in principal amount of convertible debt securities and less than $200,000 in aggregate fair market value. As a result, an investment manager that is required to file Form 13F will be required to report all of the holdings of 13(f) Securities in accounts over which the investment manager exercises investment discretion. CEFA believes that this change would enhance the ability of closed- end funds to communicate with its shareholders and should not have a significant impact on investment managers subject to Form 13F. The proposal also would amend the instructions in Form 13F regarding confidential treatment requests by requiring investment managers seeking confidential treat ment for information contained in Form 13F to show (i) that the information is both customarily and actually kept private by the investment manager, and (ii) how the release of such information could cause harm to the investment manager. This change, which is designed to implement the new standard recently established by the U.S. Supreme Court for confidential treatment of information, should enhance the ability of closed- end funds to communicate with shareholders and investment managers. 2345 Grand Boulevard, Suite 1750 | Kansas City, MO 64108 | 816.413.8900 | CEFA .com II. Comments on Proposed Form 13F Threshold Increase CEFA is greatly concerned that the Commission’s proposed increase to the Form 13F reporting threshold will make it significantly more difficult for closed- end funds and other issuers to identify and communicate with their shareholders. This will make it more difficult and expensive to solicit proxies, achieve quorum, and make it more likely proxy solicitations will extend for longer periods and ultimately fail to achieve required votes. Many closed- end funds --as well as Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) sponsors and managers --rely on Form 13F to identify their shareholders. The Commission’s press release relating to the proposal states that the Commission believes the proposed new threshold will continue to capture the vast majority of the dollar value of transactions in 13(f) securities. Nevertheless, it clearly would reduce the insight that issuers have into who owns their shares. The obstacles that closed- end funds and other issuers face in identifying and communicating with shareholders are significant. In many cases, more than 90 percent of the shares of closed- end funds are held in street name. Funds do not have access to information regarding “objecting beneficial owners.” Although closed -end funds have access to “ non-objecting beneficial owner” information, funds must pay a “per name” fee for the list and are prohibited from send ing proxy materials directly to such shareholders. Unfortunately, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules have made it easier f or activist investors to block routine actions at closed- end fund shareholder meetings and propose non-routine actions that are not in the best interests of long -term shareholders , such as large tender offers and liquidations . 1 Rule 452 of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) prohibits brokers from using discretionary authority to vote for the election of directors even where none of the directors has been challenged. In addition, NYSE Section 302 requires closed- end funds listed on the NYSE to hold annual meetings. This results in significant annual costs that mutual funds --including ETFs whose shares are listed--do not bear because they are not required to hold annual meetings. CEFA believes that any Commission action that reduces available information on investors and makes it more difficult and expensive for closed- end funds to solicit 1 For additional information regarding recent activist campaigns and the harm those campaigns have caused closed -end funds and their long -term shareholders, please see the Investment Company Institute’s March 2020 submission to the Commission titled “Recommendations Regarding the Availability of Closed -End Fund Takeover Defenses” available at https://www.ici.org/pdf/20 ltr cef.pdf. 2345 Grand Boulevard, Suite 1750 | Kansas City, MO 64108 | 816.413.8900 | CEFA .com proxies must be preceded by substantial reforms empowering issuers to identify and communicate directly with their shareholders. Failure to adopt such reforms before amending Form 13F puts the cart before the horse and will greatly increase the serious difficulties closed- end funds already have obtaining shareholder meeting quorums and required votes.

We represent members who are investor relations officers of public companies headquartered in Connecticut and Westchester County, New York. These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, have a combined market capitalization of over $500 billion. We also represent investor relations counselors who advise other public companies across t he country and in other countries, including counselors that provide stock surveillance and shareholder targeting analysis .

While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership reporting rules, our members believe that the proposed 35- times increase in the 13F threshold would deprive companies and investor relations professionals the transparency of valuable information t hat they need for effective issuer -investor engagement and to prepare for potential shareholder activism. As part of the investor relations responsibility for effective issuer -investor engagement, one of the most important duties of our members is to advise their C -suite executives on whether to accept a meeting or call request from an institutional investor, and to ascertain the investor’s motive for requesting that meeting. Our members must assess whether the investor is legitimately interested in in itiating or maintaining an investment or has an u lterior motive such as shorting the stock, proposing management change or learning competitive information enabling the investor to invest in another related company. A key consideration in advising C -Suite executives is the knowledge that the investor actually holds the company’s shares, the size of that position, whether the investor is increasing or decreasing that position, and whether the investor has a track record of activism. To make these determina tions, most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available. 2 While some of this information is out of date by the time companies receive it, given the 45 -day time lag, this data is never theless critical for companies when they decide how to prioritize investor requests for engagement. 3 2 Unfortunately, companies cannot simply accept investors’ ownership representations at face value. In a 2016 survey of NIRI members, 45 percent said they definitely had experiences with inve stors who misrepresented their positions to obtain meetings with C -suite executives, while another 31 percent said they suspected that had happened. Some buy -side managers receive financial incentives that reflect the number of C -suite meetings they obtain . 3 As lawyers from Wachtell , Lipton observed, “In proposing the revision, the SEC has suggested that the new threshold will further the primary goals of Form 13F, including gathering data about investment activities of institutional investment managers; facilitating consideration of the impact of these managers on the securities markets; and increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the securities markets. It is difficult to see how eliminating the limited transparency into ownership by activist and other hedge funds, and instead increasing the percentage of 13(f) information provided by ‘price -taking ’ index funds rather than smaller active funds that set prices, will further those goals. Contrary to both the original intent of Rule 13(f) and the current market use of 13(f) information, adoption of the SEC’s current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company’s institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investo rs who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis.” Adam O.

Niles, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, ""Going Dark: SEC Proposes Amendments to Form 13F,"" July 19, 2020, available at: https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/07/19/going- dark-sec- proposes -amendments -to-form -13f/ 3 As an example of the critical importance of this information and the negative consequences of the proposed threshold change , one of our chapter members is an Investor Relations director for a publicly traded company in the business services sector with a market capitalization of approximately $1 billion. Based on the 13F filings from June 30, 2020, this member’s firm would see a decrease of 38% in its number of filers. A dditionally, there would be a decrease of 40% in active filers, which creates a large barrier between the company’s leadership team and investment community, making it difficult to address key investor concerns and/or maintain communication between both parties. In another example, an Investor Relations consultant in our chapter represents a microcap steel company headquartered in Pennsylvania that would see a 35% decrease in the number of its 13F filers, including a 44% decrease in its top 25 holders that would be required to file , based on June 30, 2020 13F filings . As one might expect, s mall and mid -cap issuers typically have a greater percentage of mid and small sized institutional investors which would be exempt from reporting under the proposed rule. As a result, small and midcap issuers would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. 4 As Commission er Allison Herren Lee pointed out in her dissenting statement, many small er companies cannot afford to hire a stock surveillance firm or take other measures to attempt to offset the loss of 13F data, and thus would lose visibility in to a significant percentage of their investors .5 This may discourage private small and midcap issuers from seeking access to public markets in initial public offerings. For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt the proposed 35- times increase in the 13F reporting threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer -investor engagement.

Tony Vargas,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223447.htm,,"Sep. 16, 2020 Hello, In regards to RIN 3235-AM65, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers. Here is my personal response to all the questions that were raised as well as other commentary; Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1? Is the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion appropriate? No $100 million is fine and will continue to be so until every US Citizen is a millionaire. If another threshold would be more appropriate, what should the threshold be and why? N/A. 2. Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(f) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? Yes If so, how? Hedge Fund managers could be going on to CNBC or Fox Business news and state that they are building a position in a company, only to find out at minimum 45 days later that they were just trying to keep the price up for other investors to buy shares. And if so, is there a different threshold that would be more appropriate? N/A Are there any additional effects of raising the Form 13F reporting threshold that we have not considered? Individual investors will end up being the ones who are getting burned by the SEC showing us that they don't care about their confidence in the market. 3. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? No Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis for this calculation? N/A. 4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively reflect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? No For example, under this approach, we could take the market size as of the end of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, average 27 those values, and compare that average to the size of the U.S. equities market in 1975. If so, why? N/A Is such a five-year period (or other period) more appropriate for calculating an average growth rate to apply over the 45 years since the threshold was initially set? No this is not fine. 5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis for this calculation? N/A. If so, how should we measure stock market returns? Either way is fine you can add a column with dividends and one without as some fund managers may choose to allocate capital elsewhere. For example, would dividends be included or excluded? Please see above. Is there another measure that we should use as a basis for initially adjusting the reporting threshold? Either the highest or lowest price of the security during the 3 month reporting period. 6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F to account for consumer price inflation? No If so, what measure of consumer price inflation—PCE or CPI—should we use? No Is there another measure of consumer price inflation (or other inflation measure) that we should use? How about using the Gini-coefficient and waiting until it drops to .3 or below to start raising the reporting threshold. If so, what? Income inequality would be greatly reduced and there would be greater participation in the stock market. 7. Should we adopt a different rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? $100 million is a good number to keep. For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3.6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a different rounding convention, why? N/A, I want to keep it at $100 Million. 8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers?No they are not, they can literally have a program that extrapolates the required data and it could be saved in a draft prior to being sent to the SEC. Most major brokerages can provide this service. If so, how? None, mundate at worst. Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Relative terms, Warren Buffett doesn't use a computer, but his firm manages to get the data to the SEC every quarter. Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? Most smaller managers should be able to manage this, if not a service should cost no more than a few hundred dollars. 9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? This allows people to get a feel for the market and see what the ""smart"" money is doing. Though in the long term I might add most hedge funds fail to beat the market. Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? Yes. If so, why? Confidence in the markets. 10. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to larger managers? No. If so, how? They have capital to offset this. Is it beneficial to the markets to continue to have access to Form 13F data from larger managers? Yes. If so, why? Confidence in the markets. Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? Yes. If so, why? Virtually all filings should be electronic and automated quarterly to be sent to the SEC. 11. Who uses Form 13F data? Individual investors, other hedge funds to see what their competitors are doing. Newsmedia to publish clickbait articles, i.g. ""You won't believe what this hedge fund just invested in!"" RIA, brokerage houses, members of government, students, people browsing your website, etc. Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Yes this is beneficial to investors. Why do you think I am taking hours out of my life to answer all of these questions? Why or why not? This can give conviction on a position or sector that others hedge funds have entered to or exited from. How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and fewer filers report? Less positions to see, they would also get a smaller sample size of where the smart money is going. Do those users prefer a different threshold? No. Why or why not? Don't fix what isn't broken. Can those users reasonably find alternative sources of data that meet their needs? No. Why or why not? There is only one financial market in America. 12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? These costs are more inflated than a Law Enforcement drug bust of a combination of 35 kilos of Meth & Heroin valued at $11.7 million dollars. Yes this was really in the news. Compliance costs are minimal unless the firm has nepotism or doesn't know how to properly staff. What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? None different that larger firms. How do the costs differ for larger and smaller managers? None, larger managers would have more experienced staff or a third party to assist them. How much internal time do managers devote to compliance with Form 13F? N/A. What are the external costs, such as the cost of a third-party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? Minimal, think of it as an industry standard to ensure public confidence. I'm sure that Brokerage houses would gladly assist with the filing requirements/reporting just for the chance to custody at minimum $100 million. We request comment on the direct compliance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13F, including the estimates in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers. 13. We also request comment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect costs, such as the potential for front-running and copycatting. Do commenters agree that these indirect costs are incurred? This just re-assures confidence in the markets, what happens if the price that they paid for went down? Are we going to blame this on short sellers? How do these indirect costs differ for larger and smaller managers? N/A Are there other or different indirect costs that are incurred in connection with Form 13F? The cost of time for individuals such as myself in arguing for keeping the status quo. What are those and how would they be affected by the proposed amendments? It would signal a loss of confidence in the markets. 14 - Consequently, Form 13F data of smaller managers may be more likely to be used by other market participants to engage in behavior that is damaging to the manager and the beneficial owners of the managed portfolio, such as front running (which primarily harms the beneficial owners) or copycatting (which potentially harms the portfolio manager), which may increase the costs of investing for smaller managers and hinder their investment performance. Frontrunning has always existed, the only thing that has changed has been the methodologies. In this case they have an entire quarter plus up to 45 days after to build a position. If the ""Smart"" hedge fund money cannot do this then there must be something wrong with their investment style. Copycatting further reinforces the conviction of that particular security, also lowering the amount of available float. I'm not sure how this would hinder the portfolio and how can the SEC be sure if there is no evidence in the 53 page pdf that addresses this? From Footnote 34 On page 8 it states; ""Institutions have countered by raising concerns of copycatters and front-runners13 who may try to anticipate trades that are revealed too soon after the quarter end."" Maybe if the hedge funds waited the 45 days they could then not be a victim of front running, this is the literal equivalent of going on CNBC & announcing that you are building up a position in ABC inc. On page 9 of the same reportit states; ""Brown and Schwarz (2013) make the novel observation that hedge funds can take advantage of copycat traders by trading into these trades near the disclosure date i.e. selling shares at the disclosure when they know that the copycats will buy."" I guess that the ""copycats"" and the ""front-runners"" who expect to be selling will end up being the bag holders. I also wanted to comment on the paragraph below as I believe that this paragraph is the best microcosm of the entire proposal to amend the 13F. The Commission believes that, for smaller managers, the proposed Form 13F reporting threshold increase is likely not only to enhance competition by lowering the cost to participate in the market but also to promote efficiency, which can benefit investors in the form of lower management fees and/or enhanced services. Furthermore, because the proposed Form 13F reporting threshold increase would potentially reduce the exposure of smaller managers to harmful, and in many cases inappropriate, actions by other market participants, such as front running, smaller managers would likely be encouraged to invest in small and mid-size portfolio companies that are more susceptible to the harmful effects of these behaviors. This increased investment would facilitate capital formation in smaller and medium sized companies. Similarly, protecting smaller managers from these harmful behaviors would likely promote competition between smaller and larger managers by helping to level the playing field for smaller managers. Investors would similarly benefit from the price impacts of this competition as well as any reduction in harmful trading behaviors. These hedge funds charge the normal 2 & 20, if they cannot budget properly maybe the individual investors should pull out their money. In regards to front-running why not propose to Congress to make it illegal? I'm sure that the SDNY Attorney General's office could assist your office. Another proposal is to lobby Congress to pass a law Stamp Duty tax similar to what Hong Kong has. Smaller managers would invest in what they feel aligns with their investment objectives, why do they have to invest in mid & small caps? Is there a capital requirement beyond share price that hedge fund managers must adhere to? Is there a minimum amount of shares that they need to buy? It sounds like the SEC is telling them to only buy securities in their ""league."" The intent of the proposal is to assist the smaller managers, what about the individual investor? This does not appear to the greater public interest in transparency."

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File No. S7 -08-20 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Secretary Countryman: I am writing on behalf of the Consumer Federation of America (CFA)1 to express our strong opposition to the Commission’s proposal to radically increase the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers. Our opposition may co me as something of a surprise to the Commission, which appears to have relied heavily on a few sentences in a letter we co -signed 17 years ago as evidence of support for its proposed approach. In the ensuing years, however, much has changed in the markets, including the rapid growth of private funds that operate with far less transparency than their registered counterparts and dramatic advances in information technology, which have simultaneously increased the speed with which such reports can be compiled a nd decreased the cost of doing so. It is disappointingly consistent with the Commission’s recent approach to its regulatory responsibilities that it has failed to seriously consider these developments in issuing its proposal, or indeed to have conducted an y meaningful analysis of the proposal’s potential impact on users of the 13F data. Accordingly, we urge the Commission to withdraw its proposal until it can conduct a credible analysis of the issues at play in this decision. That analysis should , at a minimum, seek to determine: whether any increase in the reporting threshold is warranted (and permitted under the statute); if so, at what level the reporting threshold should be set; what the impact of any such increase would be on the various stakeholders who rely on the reports; whether additional categories should be added to the list of securities investment managers are required to report; whether shortcomings in the reports identified by the Commission’s Office of Inspector General in its 2010 report, including weakne sses in the agency’s oversight of the 13(f) reporting process, have been adequately addressed; and whether the 45 -day reporting delay included in the rule continues to be warranted. Until such an analysis is completed, we cannot support any increase in the reporting threshold, let alone the 35 -fold increase the Commission has proposed. Should 1 The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) is a non -profit association of more than 250 national, state and local pro-consumer organizations. It was established in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, advocacy, and education. 2 the Commission determine, based on that analysis, that an increase in the reporting threshold is both warranted and permitted under the statute, it should balance any such increase with other changes needed to update and improve the usefulness of the 13F reports. 1) The proposal is based on a misrepresentation of the legislative record. As the Commission itse lf acknowledges, Congress adopted Section 13(f) in order to close “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors.”2 To justify its proposal to eliminate the reporting requirement for an estimated 90 percent of current filers of Form 13F, the Commission now suggests that Congress intended to accomplish that goal of increased data collection by requiring reporting from only the very largest investment managers. And the Release cherry -picks quotes from the legislative record to support this claim. It states, for example, that the legislative history “indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed so that reporting would cover a large proportion of managed assets, while minimizing the number of reporting persons” and that the $100 million threshold was adopted to limit “the burdens of reporting, particularly on smaller managers.”3 A more complete reading of the legislative record makes clear, however, that the $100 million reporting threshold was intended as an “initial” threshold designed to allow for rapid implementation of the reporting requirement.4 Far from intending that this initial focus on only the largest institutional investment managers would be retained in perpetuity, Congress specifically authorized the Commission to lower the threshold to as little as $10 million – a level that would have captured all but the very smallest insti tutional investment managers – if the Commission “found that a lower test re quiring more institutional investment managers to report was in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or necessary or appropriate to maintain fair and orderly markets.”5 2) The Commission ignores the factors Congress intended for it to consi der in adjusting the reporting threshold. Congress authorized the Commission to lower the reporting threshold, but only after taking certain factors into consideration. On the one hand, Congress sought to ensure that the Commission would “consider the cos t and burden of preparing such reports to smaller institutional investment managers.” But it also sought to ensure that the Commission would balance those cost considerations against “the public interest that would be served by the expected informational v alue of the marginal equity securities holdings which would then be subject to the reporting provisions.”6 That balancing of the costs of reporting against the benefits of greater transparency is almost entirely absent from the proposing Release. 2 Securities and Exchange Commission, File No. S7 -08-20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (Jul. 10, 2020), at 8, https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf . 3 Id. at 9. 4 Report to Accompany S.249, Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Sen. Rep. No. 94 -75, at 85, 94th Cong. 1975 (“Senate Report”), https://bit.ly/3c2Endd . 5 Id. at 86. 6 Id. The bill also requires the Commission to consult with certain specified federal and state regulatory authorities, national securities exchanges, and national securities organizations in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities. (See Senate Report at 85.) It does not appear that the Commission has engaged in the required consultation. 3 For exa mple, the Release fails to explore, except in the most superficial way, how the reports are currently used and how its proposal would affect the informational value of the reports to the many different types of current users. It also fails to analyze the e ffectiveness of the reporting requirement in fulfilling Congress’s goal of eliminating “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors” or what if any chan ges are needed to improve the informational value of the reports. Instead, the Release’s “analysis” of the proposal’s impact focuses almost exclusively on the direct and indirect cost of reporting to institutional asset managers, but even there the analysis is superficial, distorted, and incom plete. Any analysis of whether to raise the reporting threshold should start with a consideration of what Congress was trying to achieve in imposing the reporting requirement. Nothing in the legislative record suggests that Congress’s exclusive interest was in collecting data on those funds “whose holdings of section 13(f) securities are large relative to the overall size of the U.S. equities market,” as the Commission seeks to suggest.7 On the contrary, Congress was clearly concerned with the growing rol e of institutional investment managers and their impact on the securities markets in the aggregate. The Senate Report states, for example: “During the middle and late 1960’s, the amount of securities held and traded by institutional investment managers increased materially, both in absolute terms and in relation to other types of investors. Many people became concerned about the effects of such an increase upon the securities markets, upon the issuers of the securities, and upon the interests of individual investors.”8 Pointing to the lack of a centrally located body of data, the Report concluded, as the SEC had before it, that “there was an overriding need to locate basic facts about all types of institutional investment managers, including banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, and investment companies.”9 Both Congress and the Commission foresaw extensive benefits to a wide array of stakeholders from the data collection. Congress predicted, for example, that “the management of individual compani es” would benefit from being able to “identify the holders of their stock” in order to more easily “communicate directly with the beneficial owners of [their] securities.”10 Congress also saw significant benefits to both individual and institutional inv estors, who would be able to factor the information provided into their investment decisions. As the Senate Report stated: “Many people believe that it is not possible to make informed investment decisions on a security without information related to the likel y market activity and the degree of institutional concentration in the security.”11 The Report went on to predict that, “with the dissemination of 7 Release at 17. (“We considered raising the threshold to account for consumer price inflation, rather than market growth. However, we preliminarily determined that the group of managers covered by using a market growth standard better reflects the group of managers intended to be subject to reporting under section 13(f) because this approach focuses on managers whose holdings of section 13(f) securities are large relative to the overall size of the U.S. equities market.”) 8 Senate Report at 78. 9 Id. 10 Senate Report at 80. 11 Senate Report at 82. (“Institutional concentration may suggest a number of things to a variety of investors. For example, to some it may be a good sign because it may suggest that sophistica ted investors believe the security is a good investment. To others, it may be a danger sign indicating a potential depressing ‘overhang ,’ market illiquidity, or high price volatility. That different investors may draw different conclusions from the data is not important; rather, what is important is that information about the securities holdings and certain transactions of institutional 4 data about institutional investment managers, an institutional disclosure program should stimulate a higher de gree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of our securities markets.”12 In addition to these benefits for various market participants, Congress anticipated that the reports would be used by federal and state regulators to develop standards a nd protect the public interest.13 The SEC itself had concluded that “the course of future developments could not be accurately gauged, or reasoned regulatory policies be determined, without a continuing flow” of timely information about “institutional holdi ngs and trading in the equity security markets.”14 Ironically, however, the Commission has not even used data from the reports to provide any in - depth analysis of the likely impact of its current proposal to raise the reporting threshold. It has, for example, faile d to provide details that are certainly available to it regarding how different types of institutional investment managers and different types of securities held by those investment managers would be affected by the proposal. If anything, the 13F data ha s proved more useful than Congress or the Commission ever anticipated.15 The Commission itself acknowledges that, “While Form 13F was originally designed to assist regulators and the public in understanding the effects of institutional equity ownership on t he markets, the pool of users of the data has expanded to include academics, market researchers, the media, attorneys pursuing private securities class -action matters, and market participants (including institutional investors themselves) who use the data to enhance their ability to compete.”16 The Commission cannot reasonably move forward with a proposal to raise the reporting threshold without carefully considering the impact on these many users of the 13F data, something it has failed to do in this Release. 3) Market changes since the 13F reporting requirement was adopted have made the data more relevant, not less. Since the adoption of the 13F reporting requirement, the extent to which the market is dominated by institutional investment managers has only grown, rendering the reports even more relevant today than they were in 1975. For example, in 2013, when NYSE Euronext, the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals (SCSGP), and the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) jointly filed a ru lemaking petition calling on the agency to eliminate reporting delays and adopt other reforms, supporters of the petition cited the “tremendous growth in assets owned by institutional investors in the more than three decades since Form 13F reporting obliga tions were mandated, and the parallel decrease in direct shareholdings by individuals.”17 While some of those institutional investment managers are subject to detailed investment managers b e available to all investors – both institutional and individual – so that they can all have it, what ever its relative usefulness in making their independent judgments.”) 12 Id. 13 Senate Report at 85.

(“In 1980, 28 percent of 5 reporting requirements, in addition to the 13F reports, that provide significant transpar ency into their portfolio holdings, others are not. Indeed, a considerable portion of the growth in assets held by institutional investment managers has occu rred among the private funds – hedge funds, private equity fund s, and venture capital funds – that are among the least transparent institutional investment managers.18 The variety of securities held by these institutional investment managers also has multiplied since the reporting requirement was first adopted. The Commission’s Office of Inspector Gene ral raised this issue in its 2010 report, voicing concern that, as a result, “the public cannot obtain a complete picture of all significant investment activities of institutional investment managers.”19 As far back as 1998, then House Energy a nd Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell complained that, because the list of securities that have to be reported has become obsolete, the information reported “does not reveal much about the trading activities of hedge funds or the ways in which they r aise capital or their risk profiles.”20 Other observers have raised concerns about the resulting ability of a “determined investment adviser” to evade the reporting requirement “by employing sophisticated derivative hedging techniques to create or enhance p ortfolio opacity,” because “holdings of other options and derivatives need not be disclosed” in the 13(f) filings.21 If the Commission were to increase the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, a s proposed, it would become even easier for investment manage rs to use such tactics to evade the reporting requirement entirely. Because the threshold is based on a fund’s holdings of 13F securities, and not the overall value of its portfolio, elevating the reporting threshold to this level not only “gives funds an incentive to cut their investments at the end of quarters,” it also creates an incentive to “enter into derivatives transactions that don’t count toward the $3.5 billion reporting level.”22 Funds that couldn’t hope to make it under the $100 million reportin g threshold using such tactics could do so easily if the threshol d were raised to $3.5 billion. Before raising the reporting threshold, t he Commission has an obligation to consider the impact of th is sort of gamesmanship on market transparency and public confidence in the integrity of the m arkets. outstanding U.S. equities were held by institutional investors, but by 2009 institutional ownership had grown to 51 percent of outstanding U.S. equities.” The authors went on to note that, “Institutional investors often have shorter - term investment horizons than individual investors; hedge funds, for example, which manage more than $2 trillion in assets, have an average turnover rate of 35 percent per quarter.”) 18 The growth of these private funds, while already underway when we filed our earlier comment letter addressing this topic, has greatly accelerated since that time. Moreover, the Commission has recently pursued a regulatory agenda designed to make it easier for retail investors to invest in such funds, incr easing the need for insight into their activities. 19 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Inspector General , Office of Audits, Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements, Report No. 480 (Sept. 27, 2010), at 25 -26, https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oig/reports/audi ts/2010/480.pdf . (“The types of information and categories of investments required to be reported under Section 13(f) have not been updated since the enactment of that Section in 1975. …. More sophisticated investment vehicles, such as derivatives or share s of open -end investment companies and mutual funds that might have been used to hedge equity securities, are not required to be reported on Form 13F. As a consequence, the public cannot obtain a complete picture of all significant investment activities of institutional investment managers.”) 20 Hogging the Hedge at 1094 -1095. 21 Id. 22 Weiss, Bain, and Parmar . 6 In short, there is a strong case to be made that Section 13(f) reporting requirements are in need of an update to “close substantial gaps in information about the investment activities of institutional investment managers and their impacts on both securities markets and corporate issuers.” Numerous concrete suggestions have been put forward to achieve that goal.23 Instead of acting to improve the informational value of the reports, however, the Commission’s proposal would make existing shortcomings in the reports much worse. 4) The Commission has failed to give adequate consideration to the value of the information that would be lost under its proposal to a variety of market participants. The Commission itself acknowledges that the data provided on Form 13F is “used for a wide variety of purposes,” that different uses developed as the data became publicly available, and that users of the data today go well beyond those originally anticipated by Congress when it enacted the reporting requirement.24 The Commission further acknowledges that: “These uses developed, in part, due to the increased volume of Form 13F data as more and more managers became subject to the filing requirement.”25 It is reasonable to assume then, that if use of the information increa sed as more managers became subject to the filing requirement, use of the data would likely decline significantly if the reporting threshold were raised to the point that 90 percent of current filers were no longer required to report. The Commissio n summarily discounts this concern, however, stating without evidence its view that, “the investing public specifically would be less concerned about the availability of portfolio holdings of these smaller managers because the activities of these smaller managers a re not likely to cause market effects of the type contemplated by section 13(f).”26 Knowledgeable observers strongly disagree. As Eduardo Gallardo, an attorney who specializes in mergers and acquisitions and corporate governance, recently wrote in a post on the Columbia Law School Blue Sky Blog, the Commission’s premise that data regarding portfolio holdings of smaller managers is less valuable “ignore[s] the realities of a modern market and media ecosystem that permits small, vocal participants to greatl y increase their significance to public companies, including through a heavy reliance on derivative instruments that do not even count toward the Form 13F reporting threshold. Unlike in 1975, activists with minimal ‘real’ equity exposure can today threaten to launch credible campaigns against multi -billion dollar public companies.”27 That reality strongly argues for retaining the current reporting threshold, Gallardo argues, in order to both “facilitate consideration of the influence of institutional investm ent managers on the securities markets” and “increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets,” as Congress intended. Other securities attorneys have echoed, and expanded upon, this concern. As a group of attorneys from Wachtell, Lipton recently wrote in a Harvard Law School blog, “adoption of the SEC’s current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company’s institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagemen t, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to 23 See, e.g., recommendations in the OIG Report and the NIRA rulemaking petition and legislative proposal. 24 Release at 21 -22. 25 Id. 26 Id. at 24. 27 Eduardo Galla rdo, Why the SEC’s Proposal to Amend Rule 13f -1 Should F ail, The CLS Blue Sky Blog (Jul. 27, 2020), https://bit.ly/3kilpSA . 7 accumulate shares on a stealth basis.”28 Form 13F “is often the primary means by which investors, companies and other market participants first learn or verify that an act ivist hedge fund is accumulating or has accumulated a significant (but less than 5%) position in a target company’s stock,” they explained. Because many activists do not own $3.5 billion of 13 F securities, adoption of the proposal would “make it signific antly more difficult to determine whether an activist, or a ‘wolf pack’ of activists, owns a stake in a company [and]... activist ‘tipping’ could well res ult in only the wolf pack – and not the target c ompany or other shareholders – being aware of the owne rship stake until the moment that the activist strike occurs.”29 Others have raised similar concerns that many activist hedge funds would no longer be required to report under the Commission’s proposal, noting that these are “hardly the smaller fund mana gers that regulators say the overhaul is supposed to benefit.”30 According to Gallardo, for example, increasing the ownership threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion “would allow some of the most prolific activist hedge funds to cease filing Form 13F re ports altogether. … Tellingly, out of FactSet’s SharkWatch 50 table of top activists, only 10 would be required to file Form 13F reports under the new 13F reporting threshold.”31 Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has tracked equity hedge fund positioning on a quarterly basis since 2007, said the proposed change “would cut the number of funds in its analysis to 59 from 822, and shrink equity assets covered to $815 billion from $1.2 trillion.”32 This loss of transparency into important and influential instituti onal asset managers raises serious concerns. It is particularly troubling that the Commission is proposing to decrease the data available about hedge funds at the same time that it is taking steps to expand retail investor access to such investments. In an environment in which moderately well off, but financially unsophisticated, retail investors are being actively marketed investments in hedge funds and other private funds, transparency around holdings of these funds is made more important, not less. The C ommission has an obligation to factor that into its regulatory decision -making. Among those most likely to suffer significant harm under the Commission’s proposal, according to knowledgeable observers, are small and mid -sized companies. For example, NIRI spokesman Ted Allen predicted that, “If this rule goes through, you will see more small and mid - sized companies getting ambushed by hedge funds. This will increase activism in all of the mid - cap companies because there will be less transparency.”33 In addition, the proposal would make it more difficult for these smaller companies to “identify and engage with many of their shareholders,” according to Gallardo.34 Gallardo noted that the 13F reports “are particularly useful for small er issuers that may not be able to afford more costly stock -surveillance 28 Adam O.

As one example, Alphacution Research Conservatory has identified 13F data as “a very important dataset.”36 In a recent posting on the firm’s website, Alphacution’s Director of Research Paul Rowady ex plains how Alphacution “has leveraged the entire 13F report as a signal for a manager’s underlying strategy” and the evolution of that strategy over time. Using that analysis as its starting point, Alphacution has “been able to leverage a library of 13F -supported models to compare notable managers and illuminate an expanding spectrum of their impacts on the trading and asset management ecosystem.”37 Much of the value of that data would be lost under the Commission’s proposal, which threatens to filter out da ta from smaller, but highly “impactful” investment managers, according to Rowady.38 The Commission cannot reasonably move forward with this proposal without carefully assessing its impact on issuers, market analysts, and others who benefit from the transp arency the current reporting regime provides. 5) The Commission has failed to use the 13F data to analyze the impact of its proposal on different types of stakeholders. A key goal of Congress in adopting the 13F reporting requirement was that the Commission would use the data to support more informed policymaking. Ironically, the Commission has failed to conduct even a superficial analysis of that data to weigh the impact of its current proposal to raise the reporti ng threshold on different types of issuers and different types of asset mana gers. Others, who appear to have made better use of the 13F reports than the Commission has done, confirm that the proposal would have both a significant impact on market transparency overall and sharply different impacts on different segments of the marke t. For example, IHS Markit analyzed the impact of the Commission proposal and found that it would cause 55 percent, on average, of an issuer’s shareholders to stop filing Form 13Fs.39 The impact on smaller companies would be particularly significant, with small cap companies losing insight into 14.6 percent of total shares outstanding, on average, and micro -cap companies losing insight into 17.1 percent of total shares outstanding. Companies in the Energy (16.5 percent), Healthcare (14.9 percent), and Techn ology (12.8 percent) sectors would experience particularly 35 Id. 36 Paul Rowady, “The Evolving Value of 13F Reporting: Building a Macro -Structure Cockpit,” Alphacution Research Conservatory website, last accessed Sept. 15, 2020, https://bit.ly/3h yUkZM . 37 Id. 38 Rowady suggests an alternative approach designed to “capture a comprehensive roster of institutional investment managers that are impactful to the market ecosystem. In others words, given the growing body of evidence that the industrialized use of technology leads to ‘winner -take-all’ dynamics in all types of markets, we need to make sure that new value -only thresholds are not set such that smaller, yet highly impactful, investment managers are filtered out with new 13F disclosure rules.” 39 SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis , IHS Markit -Ipreo (Aug. 7, 2020), https://bit.ly/2Ru0aAP . 9 sharp declines in insight into holders of their securities, according to the IHS Market analysis.40 The loss of transparency for smaller companies is particularly troubling, in light of the Commissi on’s often voiced concern over the struggles these companies can face in attracting investor interest and interacting with shareholders. IHS Markit also found significant differences in how the proposal would affect different types of institutional asset managers. Specifically, it found that index investors, where the Form 13F reports arguably offer the least added value, would be least affected by the proposal “as they would still have to file for 99% of the dollar value which they currently file for.”41 At the other end of the spectrum, the proposal would result in a decline of 20.4 percent in “total filing dollars” for specialty investors and 32.9 percent for alternative investors.42 By focusing exclusively on the overall percentage of the dollar value of Form 13F holding data that would be retained under the Commission’s proposal, the Release obscures these disparate impacts on different types of issuers and different types of funds. The Commission cannot reasonably move forward with this proposal without taking these potentially significant harmful impacts on certain sectors of the market into account. 6) The Commission’s estimated cost savings appear to be greatly exaggerated. The Co mmission estimates compliance cost savings of $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager for a total savings in compliance costs across the industry of $68.1 million to $136 million.43 The Commission has failed to provide any evidence to support those figures, which are nearly four times the Commission’s past estimates of the overall cost, except to state that it is based on “staff analysis and outreach to managers.”44 A number of parties, including Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, have expressed skepticism with regard to the accuracy of these estimated compliance cost savings.45 As Commissioner Herren Lee stated, “This new estimate, in addition to being impossible to reconcile with past Commission estimates, is difficult to square with the substantive requirement s of Form 13F.” Gallardo similarly stated that the estimate “seems inflated given the limited information required and the fact that Form 13F filings are typically managed in -house by existing compliance departments.”46 The Release also barely acknowledge s how technological advances have lowered the cost of reporting since 13F was adopted. It states, albeit grudgingly, that “some of the direct compliance costs associated with preparing filings on Form 13F have decreased since 1975, 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Id. 43 Release at 17 -18. 44 Release at 18. 45 Statement of Commissioner Allison Herren Lee on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting (Jul. 10, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee -13f-reporting -2020 -07-10. (Citing the Commis sion’s 2018 estimate of the total compliance costs of approximately $31.2 million for the entire industry, Commissioner Herren Lee stated: “The proposal abruptly takes a new approach to the PRA estimate, increasing it to roughly $113.6 million. The nearly fourfold increase in estimated burden is driven in large part by new assumptions about the types of professionals involved in the preparation of Form 13F filings. Specifically, the Commission now assumes that each filing requires equal time from a complian ce attorney, a senior programmer, and a compliance clerk, resulting in a hefty increase in the hourly cost estimate.”) 46 Gallardo. 10 principally due to lower -cost information processing systems.”47 However, it quickly dismisses those cost reductions by adding that “direct compliance costs are likely to be proportionately higher for smaller managers than they are for larger managers.”48 There are numerous problem s with this statement, starting with the fact that many of these “smaller” managers actually manage multi -billion -dollar portfolios. They are hardly the mom and pop operations the Commission implies. But beyond that, the reporting cost decrease attributabl e to technological advances since 1975 unquestionably dwarf s the proportional differences in cost between larger and “smaller” managers, and the Commission has an obligation to factor that cost reduction into its analysis. For all these reasons, we share C ommissioner Herren Lee’s concern that “the approach to revising the burden estimate for Form 13F relies on assumptions that vastly overstate the complexity and resulting burden of the reporting requirement.” And we further agree that more detail is needed “in order to ascertain whether the analysis is sufficiently rigorous and methodologically sound, especially in light of the heavy reliance on the analysis in justifying the proposal.”49 7) The estimated cost savings, even if accurate, are not sufficient to ju stify the proposal. Even if you accept the Commission’s estimated compliance cost savings as accurate, and we do not, the projected savings are still paltry on both an individual fund basis and for the industry as a whole, particularly when weighed again st the $2.3 trillion in assets held by funds that would no longer be required to file the reports. According to the Goldman Sachs strategists quoted by OnWallStreet, for example, hedge funds view the 13F reporting costs as “inconsequential.”50 Even for fund s at the smaller end of the range, the compliance cost savings predicted by the Commission are unlikely to have any measurable impact on their “cost to participate in the market,” as the Commission suggests, let alone on the level of management fees paid b y or “enhanced services” offered to investors. Meanwhile, an added $15,000 to $30,000 a year won’t buy much additional market research , another potential benefit cited by the Commission . As such, it wouldn’t do anywhere near as much to “promote price discovery” as raising the reporting threshold will do to undermine transparency. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Commission’s proposal will seriously undermine price discovery by reducing available data. As Goldman Sachs strategists explained, “Clients believe transparency aids in price discovery. Mor e information is better than less.”51 For the Commission to suggest that projected compliance cost savings would have the beneficial effects it attributes to this proposal is patently absurd. Perhaps recognizing that its proposal cannot be justified base d on these paltry compliance cost savings, the Commission speculates that institutional investment managers also may face significant “indirect costs such as the potential for front -running and copycatting” as a result of the reporting requirement.52 The SEC itself acknowledges that the academic literature it cites as supporting its views provide s, at best, “partial” evidence, and generally did not demonstrate harm to the reporting entities related 47 Release at 13. 48 Statement of Commissioner Herren Lee. 49 Id. 50 OnWallStreet article. 51 Id. 52 Release at 19. 11 to the front running and copycatting issues that the SEC sugg ested might be problematic.53 Other market participants appear to find this argument regarding indirect costs even less credible than the Commission’s estimated compliance costs. The Goldman Sachs strategists, for example, argue that the front -running concern is “backwards because the filing takes place after the purchase occurs and with a 45 -day lag after quarter -end.”54 Moreover, as the Bloomberg article explains, the 13F filings “are more a snapshot than a true depiction of what fund managers’ have in their portfolios,” both because of the r eporting delay and because they do not cover the full range of a fund’s investments.55 The Commission itself has questioned the validity of this concern in the past. For example, it stated in a 2004 final rule release that, “Fund portfolio holdings have b een required to be disclosed on Form 13F, aggregated by investment manager, since 1979. By contrast, concerns about predatory trading practices arising from Form 13F have surfaced recently in the context of the current proposal. Commenters have not present ed concrete evidence that quarterly disclosure of aggregate holdings by institutional investment managers on Form 13F has resulted in such trading practices.”56 The Release provides no new concrete evidence to support this concern. But even if it were to f ully validate its estimated cost savings with concrete evidence , those savings do not justify its proposal to eliminate the 13F filing requirement for roughly 4,500 investment managers and $2.3 billion in assets. Moreover, this analysis, in additi on to being unsupported by evidence, fails to take into consideration the economic impact of the Commission ’s proposal on issuers, market analysts, and other users of the 13F reports . As discussed above, those negative impacts are likely to be considerable for important sect ors of the market – far more consequential than the paltry cost savings the Commission projects for institutional investment m anagers. To be credible, the Commission ’s analysis would need to examine these impacts on different sectors of the market under the proposed approach and compare the results to projected impacts under various reasonably available alternatives . In short, the Commission cannot reaso nably move forward with this proposal without first providing a more thorough and credible economic analysis, more clearly detailing the assumptions behind and findings of that analysis, and demonstrating that the benefits to institutional investment manag ers outweigh the harm to other market participants and to market transparency more generally . 8) The Commission’s authority to increase the reporting threshold is unclear. All of this assumes that the Commission has the authority to raise the reporting threshold. That is far from clear. As Commissi oner Herren Lee said in her public statement, “The text [of Section 13 (f)] is clear: Congress set a statutory reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it.”57 The Release fails to adequately discuss the legal 53 Going Dark . 54 OnWallStreet article. See also, Gallardo and Going Dark. 55 Weiss, Bain, Parmar (“The filings don’t include non -U.S. traded securities or wagers against stocks, nor do they show the price at which a fund bought or sold a security.”) 56 Securities and Exchange Commission, Final Rule: Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure of Registered Management Investment Companies, File No. S7 -51-02 (Aug. 9, 2004), https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33 -8393.htm#83 . 57 Statement of Commissioner Herren Lee. 12 basis for the Commission’s action, in light of this limitation in the statute, but it appears that the Commission is relying on its exemptive authority in Section 13(f)(3). As Commissioner Herren Lee stated, “using exemptive authority in this way would vitiate the limit that Congre ss placed on our authority in the plain language of Section 13(f)(1). We would, in effect, use our exemptive authority to rewrite the statute to reflect the opposite meaning from its plain language.”58 We agree. The Commission’s recent proclivity for using its general exemptive authority to circumvent clear statutory language is a highly questionable tactic that threatens to contravene the will of Congress, as we have discussed in greater detail elsewhere.59 At the very least, the question of the Commission’ s legal authority deserves more careful consideration than it receives here. The Commission cannot reasonably move forward with this proposal without providing a much clearer explanation of the legal basis for its action. 9) The Commission should scrap the c urrent proposal and develop a balanced approach to 13F reporting reform that includes steps to enhance the informational value of the reports. Over the years, a number of market participants have urged the Commission to update the 13F reporting system to improve the information value of the reports. These include recommendations from the Commission’s own Office of Inspector General to: update the list of securities that have to be reported to better reflect the full range of assets held by institutional investment managers; require reporting of average positions held during the quarter rather than simply those held at the end of the quarter; require disclosure of aggregate purchases and aggregate sales of 13F securities during the quarter; and require mana gers to separately report holdings in proprietary accounts and holdings in customer accounts.60 They also include suggestions in the rulemaking petition from NYSE Euronext, the S CSGP, and NIRI to shorten the reporting deadline from 45 days to 15 days.61 These groups separately advocated increasing the frequency of the reports from quarterly to monthly, and urged the Commission to work with Congress to achieve this goa l.62 Some of these steps, like the proposal to increase the frequency of the reports, would require new legislation from Congress, while others appear to fall within the Commission’s existing authority. Unaccountably, the Commission has chosen to complete ly ignore those suggestions. The result is a one -sided proposal that prioritizes reducing the already minimal costs of reporting to institutional investment managers over increasing the informational value of the reports for other market participants. We believe many of the proposals that have been put forward to reform 13F reporting have merit. In particular, we believe significant benefits could be obtained by updating the list of 58 Id. 59 Letter from Barbara Roper and Micah Hauptman, Consumer Federation of America, regarding File Number S7 - 05-20, Facilitating Capital Formation and Expanding Investme nt Opportunities by Improving Access to Capital in Private Markets (Jun. 4, 2020), at 28, https://bit.ly/2H1kNlX . 60OIG Report. 61 NYSE Euronext, Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals, National Investor Relations Institute, Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Feb. 1, 2013), https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf . 62 Id. at 3. 13 securities that have to be reported. Specifically, the list should be upd ated to i nclude all equity securities – including derivatives thereof, synthetic equity securities, options on equity securities, and securities -based swaps – regardless of whether the securities are registered with the Commission or traded on an exchange. For those securities, s uch as private securities, which are valued by the fund itself, holdings of the security should count toward the reporting threshold based on whatever valuation the fund places on the security. A comprehensive approach to expanding the categories of 13F securities along these lines would be critical to bringing the reporting requirements up -to-date in a way that fulfills the underlyin g purpose of the 13F reports – closing “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and holdings of secur ities by major classes of institutional investors.” It also has the potential to greatly benefi t the Commission by providing fa r better information on which to base its regulatory actions. Without specifically endorsing each and every one of the suggestions that have been put forward by interested stakeholders, we urge the Commission to adopt a more balanced and thoughtful appraisal of the 13F reporting requirements than it has presented here. That appraisal should take into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders who benefit from the 13F reports, not just investment managers. We believe the best way for the Commission to proceed would be through publication of a Concept Release seeking comment on various reform proposals that have been put forward. Based on the input it receives, the Commission should then work with Congress on legislation to bring the 13F reporting requirements into line with modern market realities and maximize their informational value. We would welcome the opportunity t o work with the Commission in advancing such an approach. In the absence of a more careful analysis and more balanced approach, however, we cannot support any increase in the reporting threshold, particularly not the 35 -fold increase proposed without evidentiary su pport by the Commission in this Release.

Countryman, Secretary U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission I 00 F Street E Washington. DC 20549-1090 RE: File No. S7-08-20 September 15. 2020 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Amending 17 CFR 240.13 f-1 Release No. 34-89290 Dear Ms. Countryman: Truffle Hound Capital, LLC (""Truffle Hound"") appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") Release No. 34-89290 (the ""Release""), which proposes to amend Rule 13(t)( 1 ), adopted as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (the'· J 975 Amendments··) or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which set the reporting threshold for Form l 3F at $100 million. Truffle Hound strongly agrees with the Commission's proposal in the Release to raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion. Truffle Hound agrees with the Commission's view that section 13('f) was intended to provide transparenc y into the equity holdings by large institutional investment managers and that the change in size and structure of the U.S. equities market since the 1975 Amendments warrant an update to the reporting threshold for Form 13F. Truffle Hound also agrees with the Commission that it is necessary to continue to provide regulators and the public with information regarding the equities holdings of larger institutional investment managers that have the potential to significantly affect the securities markets but that the need for public disclosure of holdings of smaller managers is less compelling. In carefully reading the Release. we are impressed by the thoroughness and thoughtfulness that was put into this proposal. It is clear that the staff considered many factors from the various perspectives of investors, regulators, small investment managers, large institutional investment managers, and the general public. The 34 questions high! ighted by the staff in their request for comments show the depth of consideration and a commitment to getting these amendments implemented with the greatest overall benefit. As a small investment manager, Truffle Hound will focus its comments to the first eight questions posed by the staff in the Release.

Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13/-1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13/-1? Is the proposed threshold of $3. 5 billion appropriate? Yes, we believe that the time is right to increase the Form I 3F threshold of $100 million that was originally instituted by the 1975 Amendments. The proposed threshold of $3.5 billion is an appropriate threshold that captures the spirit of the original amendment and also maintains the focus on the three primary goals of Section I 3(t) as outlined in the Release. 2. Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(!) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? No, we do not believe that raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion will negatively affect the utility of Form 13F data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets. The largest institutional investment managers whose trading has the greatest impact on the public equity markets will still be required to make Form 13F disclosures and, even at this increased threshold, will still require disclosure of more than 90 percent of the dollar value of the Form I 3F holdings data currently reported. 3. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13/-1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Board'sflow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis for this calculation? Yes, the initial adjustment to the Form I 3F reporting threshold should be based on the growth in the U.S. equities market. Of all of the approaches outlined in the Release the growth in the U.S. equities market is the most appropriate and fair to all interested parties. It is obvious that the staff carefully considered the other potential formulas for making the adjustment, and while each has its unique case for being appropriate, it is the growth in the U.S. equities market approach that best captures the spirit of the original amendment and also maintains the focus on the three primary goals of Section I 3(t). 4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively refl.ect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? No, for this initial adjustment to the Form l 3F it is appropriate to base it on the growth that occurred between 1975 (when the 1975 Amendments were initially instituted) and December 2018. There are obviously many more complex formulas that one could propose in adjusting the threshold but the straightforward, objective, nature of this approach enhances the transparency and fairness to all interested parties. U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission September 15, 2020 Page 3 5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold.for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis.for this calculation? No, Truffle Hound believes that it would be inappropriate to adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns. Instead, we agree with the staff that the growth in the U.S. equities market is the most appropriate and fair method to adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F. 6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold.for Form J 3F to account.for consumer price inflation? No, while we believe that consumer price inflation is an important metric for policymakers, we do not believe that it is the appropriate metric to adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13 F. What consumers pay for a basket of goods may provide insight into what is happening in the overall economy but it does not necessarily correlate with the financial economy and certainly not with the fluctuations of the public equity markets. 7. Should we adopt a d(fferent rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3. 6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a d([ferent rounding convention, why? No, the nearest $500 million seems an appropriate rounding convention that has been well considered by the staff. The proposed $3.5 billion threshold closely parallels the growth in the U.S. equities market from the time that the 1975 Amendments were implemented. A lower rounding convention may lead to a more short-sighted view from institutional investment managers and regulators alike as the markets fluctuate in the near term. 8. Are the Form J 3F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers d(fferent in character.from the burdens on larger managers? Yes, Truffle Hound, as a small investment manager, certainly considers the obligation to track and file Form 13F to be burdensome. Over the last decade, we have seen increased legislation (e.g. Dodd-Frank Act) and regulation (e.g. Form PF) that have given regulators greater transparency into our business. In order to meet these new obligations, we have had to divert resources away from our main business of equity research to add to our increasing costs of compliance. This has entailed not only out-of-pocket costs, but also an increasing number of employee hours required to comply. Even as a small manager with less than $300 million in assets under management, our current regulatory burden already includes: • annual Form D filing; • state securities law compliance; • annual updates to Form ADV Parts 1 and 2; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission September 15, 2020 Page 4 • annual Form PF filing; • monitoring transactions to comply with Rule 13h-1: • annual review and revisions of the firm· s compliance manual: • annual audited financial statements; • ongoing monitoring of employee personal account trading; and • ongoing monitoring of employee emails. The burden on smaller managers is more onerous than for large institutional investment managers. A small firm like Truffle Hound, with only five full-time employees, does not have access to the same resources that a large institutional investment manager with hundreds of employees will have to devote to complying with the burden of additional regulation. This is a similar concept to what the Commission has adopted for Form PF, for which small fund advisers are only required to complete Part I on an annual basis while large hedge fund advisers are required to complete both Parts I and 2 on a quarterly basis. Thank you for this opportunit y to comment on the proposed amendment to the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers. Truffle Hound strongly urges the Commission to adopt the amendment to the rule as proposed in the Release and we look forward to seeing the final rule implemented in the near future. 1?::r1~ Paul E.

(NYSE: KOP) (“Koppers”), a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood treatment chemicals, and carbon compounds headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, I am writing to express opposition to the proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers as published by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in Release No. 34 -89290. We believe that the enactment of the SEC’s proposal, which we estimate wo uld eliminate Form 13F filing obligations for approximately 90 percent of current Form 13F filers, would result in a significant loss of valuable market transparency to Koppers and other publicly traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, i f enacted, would impair our ability to engage with many of our shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take equity positions in Koppers . Form 13F filings are the principal and most accurate source of ownership information available to U.S. public companies. While the information contained in Form 13F filings ideally would become available to companies in a more timely manner than is currently the case, we must rely on that information to determine which of our “street name” investors are transacting in our securities in a given quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced with information provided by third -party stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on the information contained in quarterly Form 13F filings as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this proposal on publicly traded companies like Koppers and th eir ability to make informed decisions regarding communications with investors in the ordinary course. Like most publicly traded companies, we particularly are concerned about how the reduction of transparency that would Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 14, 2020 Page 2 result from the implementation of the proposed amendments would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the Form 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow approximately 75 percent of our curren t investors which file Form 13Fs to evade disclosure . While some of our largest investors would continue to make Form 13F filings if the proposed amendments are enacted, many of those institutions are passive , indexed holders with positions that do not cha nge appreciably each quarter. For Koppers and many other similarly situated public companies, the information that we obtain from Form 13F filings made by active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold is much more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency As one would expect, most public companies, especially those with relatively unconcentrated shareholder bases, regularly are inundated with requests from known and purported shareholders for calls or meetings with senior executives. Koppers, like many public companies, uses Form 13F data to prioritize these requests and allocate the limited time of its senior executives among the many requests for one -on-one calls or meetings. No public comp any reasonably can accommodate every such request that it receives. The most effective way to manage these requests in the manner that best advances the long -term interests of shareholders is to give priority not only to our largest investors and fund man agers with a track record of activism but also to shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in Koppers and maintaining those positions in the long -term. With this proposed increase in the Form 13F filing threshold , we would have significantly less visibility into this important group and would be impaired in our ability to advance this important objective. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The reduction in Form 13F data also would impede the ability of companies like Koppers to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, Koppers uses Form 13F 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3 .5 billion threshold. See J eremy Cohen and Jeff Zil ka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec - propos ed·rule -change -step-193708183.html . Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 14, 2020 Page 3 filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of its outrea ch efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies like Koppers to access capital markets effectively and to grow their businesses. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding and buy ing securities each quarter would hinder the ability of public companies to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this ru lemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The SEC’s proposal also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for public companies to provide greater transparency to investors under the current circumstances, the need for the type of ownership data currently provided by Form 13F filings is even greater for public companies during these un certain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, companies like Koppers would be limited in their ability to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions in Form 13F filings, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency to further their own interests that may be very different from the interests of shareholders as a whole. The reduction in information that would be available from Form 13F filings if the proposed amendments are implemented potentially exposes public companies to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fu nd managers, who may demand that companies eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the particular company’s long -term strategy or the investment strategy of its long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism, as 470 U.S. companies were 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission – maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors – takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure – providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions – is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . . . We urge companies to provide as much info rmation as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning .” Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, “The Importance of Disclosure – For Inve stors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID -19,” April 8, 2020. Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 14, 2020 Page 4 targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the COVI D-19 pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the reduction in transparency that would result from the SEC’s proposed reduction of the Form 13F filing threshold would be especially unfortunate for companies a nd long -term investors.4 Without the scope of data currently received from Form 13F filings, public companies such as Koppers will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days a fter the fund crosses the disclosure threshold to file a Schedule 13D and publicly discloses its ownership position of five percent or more. While Koppers agrees that there are productive ways in which the SEC could modernize its ownership disclosure rules , we believe that the negative impacts of this proposal on the ability of Koppers and similarly situated public companies to engage effectively with shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed drastic 35 -fold increase in the Form 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the SEC’s inflation -based i ncrease in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies ,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, “Insight: Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,” May 4 , 2020, available at: https://news.bloombe rglaw.com/co rporate -governance /insight-preparing-for-post-pandemi c-corporate- activism . 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, “Activism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,’ ’ May 12, 2020 , available at: https://q4blog.com/2020 /05/l2/activism -in-the-post-pandemic -market -what -you-need -to-know/; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepare for post -pandemi c activism,” April 6, 2 020; available at: https: //www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards - can-prepar e-post-pandemi c-activism . 5 Inflat ion Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under T itles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33 - 10332; 34 -80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017).

We represent members who are investor relations officers at 32 publicly held companies mostly headquartered in the State of California . These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and N asdaq , have a combine d market capitalization of approximately $600 billion . We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million , would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark . This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our member s’ compan ies as well as other public companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede companies’ abilit y to attract new long -term investors, and deprive our members of timely information about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies . We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our member s’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our member s’ compan ies as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small - and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment manager s who would fa ll under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting , so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. We also agree with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee , who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduc e transparency and the public’s access to market information . She also question ed whether the SEC “has the authority to purs ue” those changes by pointing out that the “enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold. ”1 2 While o ur member s agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on their ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and monitor activists far outweigh any potential cost savings for investment managers. In addition, the proposed 35 -fold increase in the 13F threshold is not co nsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules . For the above reasons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking peti tions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.3 Rather than reduce transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by working with Congress to suppo rt monthly reporting, requir e the public disclosure of short positions, and reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period . To achieve these objectives , we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors , issuers , and the exchanges on a wide range of market transparency issues, including potential 13F reforms, propos ed rules to address “short and distort” abuses, and the modernization of 1 As Commissioner Lee point ed out in her dissenting statement : “To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection ( d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods , and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods lo nger than one year or shorter than one quarter (emphasis added) . The tex t is clear: Congress set a statuto ry reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it.

EEI is the association that represents all U.S. investor -owned electric companies. Our members provide electricity for 220 million Americans and operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a whole, the electric power industry supports more than 7 million jobs in communities across the United States. In addition to our U.S. members, E EI has more than 60 international electric companies as International Members, and hundreds of industry suppliers and related organizations as Associate Members. Organized in 1933, EEI provides public policy leadership, strategic business intelligence, an d essential conferences and forums. AGA, founded in 1918, represents 202 local energy companies that deliver clean natural gas throughout the United States. There are more than 70 million residential, commercial and industrial natural gas customers in t he U.S., of which almost 93 percent – more than 65 million customers – receive their gas from AGA members. AGA is an advocate for natural gas utility companies and their customers and provides a broad range of programs and services for member natural gas pipelines, marketers, gatherers, international gas companies and industry associates. Today, natural gas meets almost one -fourth of the United States’ energy needs. The hallmark principle of U.S. securities laws is transparency. Whether in the requirements governing a corporate registrant’s disclosure regarding its business and results of operations, an investment advisor’s disclosure of its performance record, or a broker -dealer’s disclosure of its financial capacity, the statutes and rules are designed to provide investors and the SEC with the disclosures that they need in order to make informed decisions. The same is true with respect to the institutional investor disclosures required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in particular Sectio ns 13(d), 13(f) and 13(g). The members of EEI and AGA strongly support transparency. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 1 5, 2020 – Page 2 While we appreciate that Rule 13f -1 requires filings by many more institutional investors than it did in 1975 when it first was adopted, the markets, and the activities o f institutional investors, have changed significantly during that period as well. For example, high -speed trading did not exist in 1975, so there was no need to identify for the benefit of investors the identity of the institutional investors who particip ated in that practice or of their holdings. Similarly, the phrase “activist investor,” if it existed at all in 1975, certainly was not well -known, and “corporate raider” was almost as obscure. And, in 1975, the euphemistically named “hedge funds” actuall y were “hedge” funds focused on hedging against general market risk, so transparency was less relevant to other investors. Today investors need to know about the activities of these institutional investors – they are almost per se material – even if they are conducted through smaller funds. This transparency also helps with timely outreach to and engagement with investors by issuer companies, which has been impacted by the Covid -19 pandemic. While we appreciate that the proposed amendment to Rule 13f -1 returns its scope, in terms of the number of filers, closer to its level at the time of its original adoption, we do not believe that should be the goal of the rule today. Rather, we believe that the rule should reflect current marketplace realities and co ntinue to cover “smaller” institutional investors with portfolios in excess of $100 million. It is, most often, smaller institutional investors that are most active in trying to influence the behavior of individual corporations, and thereby important to o ther investors. Larger institutional investors rarely engage in individual corporate campaigns. We also believe that the estimate of the compliance burden on filers is exaggerated. We are told that an app could be developed by the investment industry for a minimal amount that could map data from the most common securities trading platforms into an SEC filing, and the cost of running that app at the end of each quarter to prepare the SEC filing would be insignificant. Where the required information in the filing is entirely objective and easily obtained from required records, we simply do not see how the compliance cost is projected to be between $15,000 and $30,000 annually. We also are not sympathetic to the concern that the returns of hedge funds are negatively impacted by front running and the other consequences of their disclosures. Remember, the business model of hedge funds is to utilize their greater knowledge to extra ct profits from other investors who are not as well -informed. That is not a strategy that warrants special protection. In fact, we would support increasing the frequency of the Rule 13f -1 filings to monthly, reducing the filing period from 45 days to 5 d ays, and requiring full disclosure of derivative positions. It is well -established in the Section 16 realm that reporting, by a significantly larger group of less sophisticated reporting persons, within two business days is achievable. As noted above, we recommend that the Commission maintain the current $100 million reporting threshold. To the extent that the Commission increases the threshold, we believe that it should increase the threshold only by a modest amount, say to $200 or $300 million, more in line with the inflation -adjusted value. To the extent that the Commission increases the threshold to a higher level, we would encourage a two -tiered threshold with a lower threshold – the existing $100 million threshold – applicable to any institutiona l investor that within the past five years has proposed , or in the future reasonably could be expected to, propose to an issuer any Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman September 1 5, 2020 – Page 3 extraordinary transaction, any transfer of a material amount of assets, any change in its board of directors, any material c hange in its capitalization or dividends, any other material change to the business or corporate structure, or any change in charter or bylaws. This list of purposes is derived from Item 4 of Schedule 13D and would be well -understood by institutional inve stors and not impose an additional compliance burden. Ultimately, EEI and AGA strongly support transparency in the securities marketplace, and we are concerned that the proposed rule would reduce that transparency.

Of Universal Electronics' 201 institutional investors, the SEC's proposal would require only one passive index fund to file Form 13F. We believe that would significantly impair engagement with our institutional investors about our business strategy and corporate governance, reduce our ability to attract new investors, deprive us of timely information about activist funds that take significant positions in our stock, and exacerbate short-term pressures on our company at the expense of long-term shareholder value. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this l 3F proposal on public companies and their obligation to confer regularly with their investors. As a small-cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. While 13F data is not as timely it could be, it is the only data that U.S. companies have that shows in which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly l 3F data as a starting point for their research efforts.

Both of these practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business.

As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the negative impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. The loss of I 3F data will also expose our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short­ term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we slash jobs, reduce research spending, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long-term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly distraction , so many public companies (especially small and mid-cap issuers) often conclude that they have no choice but to settle with short-term activists. Market observers expect another surge in proxy fights after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC's reduction of l 3F transparency would be especially unfortunat e for companies and long-term investors. Without the I 3F data we receive now, our company would not know if activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 billion threshold) are planning a proxy contest until 10 days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent ( or often more) position, which would significantly impair our ability to protect the interests of our long­ term investors. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw these proposed l 3F amendments and instead pursue the changes proposed in rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governan ce, and Nasdaq. 1 Rather than reduce market transparency, we urge the SEC to modernize I 3F by cutting the antiquated 45-day reporting period, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and supporting monthly disclosur e by l 3F filers.

We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal for the reasons described below, as well as the opposition expressed by National Investor Relations Institute, Nasdaq, and hundreds of retail investors and publicly traded companies, among others.1 We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89% of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a $50 billion market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 1 See joint letter from NIRI, issuers, and investor relations counseling firms, dated August 28, 2020, available at: https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7709057-222930.pdf; Nelson Griggs, President of Nasdaq Stock Exchange, “Transparency is at Risk with Proposed Changes to Form 13F,” July 31, 2020, available at: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/transparency-is-at-risk-with-proposed-changes-to-form-13f-2020-07-31. 2 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 55% of our current 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.2 The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.3 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long-term shareholders. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,4 the adjustments to the transition thresholds 2 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses l 3F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the l 3F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce l 3F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicable"" to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic .2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need 1 According to Edelman's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC's proposed reduction of l3F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors.4 Without the l 3F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until IO days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position.

Over its 150-year histo1y, A&B has evolved with the state's economy and played a leadership role in the development of the agrieultural, transportation, tourism, construction, residential and eommercial real estate industries. While we endorse the eoncept of modernizing 13F reporting, we, like NIRI, believe that the proposed amendments would have negative eonsequences. Our views in that regard are set out below. As a path forward, we agree with NIRI's suggestions that the Commission withdraw this proposal and re-propose amendments with the reforms described in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.2 More specifically, instead of permitting almost 90% of current 13F filers to stop filing and reducing transparency, the Commission should reduce the reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions and support legislation to provide for more frequent disclosure,3 As proposed, the current reporting threshold would increase from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe that this change would have a dramatic and negative impact on public companies 'https://mrn-.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf (the ""Proposal""). 2 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(l) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-6591 February 4, 2013, available at: https://,,'\vw.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-659,ru;l[; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(-0 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://,n\'\V.sec.gov /rules/petitions/2015/petn4-689.\Jdf.; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at https: / /www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-691.pdf. 3 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank \/Vall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. ¥le also believe that the Commission should eliminate the ability of beneficial owners of a company to prohibit their intermediaries from disclosing their identity to such company. 822 Bishop Street Honolulu, Hawai'i 96813 p (808) 525-6611 f{808) 525-6652 alexanderbaldwin.com and the capital markets. To that end, we echo NIRI's comments as set out in their letters to the Commission, dated August 25, 2020 and August 26, 2020 4 respectively, as well as Commissioner Lee's comments in her statement regarding the proposal dated July 10, 2020.s In addition, we offer the following views regarding the proposal. Significantly Reduces Access to Public Information and Market Transparency If the proposed threshold is adopted, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers or 90% of current 13F filers -representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets -will no longer be required to file Form 13F.6 We understand that the proposed threshold is based on the growth of the U.S. equities market between 1975 and December 2018. While the Commission estimates that the increased threshold would retain disclosure for approximately 75% of the dollar value of the U.S. equities market, the transparency on that dollar value is greatly different now given the change in investment strategies since then, i.e., the rise in passive/index investing as compared to active investment strategies. Under the proposal, mostly index and passive investing will continue to be repmted, which does not provide the same transparency as tracking active and activist investing. Fmthcr, the proposed threshold does not reflect the value of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, which would be near $500 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We believe that the proposal, if adopted, will significantly and detrimentally reduce information access and market transparency, which in turn will result in reduced investor confidence and capital market efficiencies (particularly for smaller capitalization companies), and fmther will provide a disincentive for privately owned companies to go public. When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) in 1975, it did so to ""stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.""7 However, the current proposal is antithetical to that legislative intent and will have the opposite effect on public companies and our capital markets, the efficiency of and the confidence in which is wholly dependent on information access and transparency. Clouds Crowding Risk The proposal will create a lack of clarity regarding crowding risk due to fewer hedge fund manager filings. Investors use 13F filings of top hedge fund managers to understand crowding risk and in turn to appropriately hedge their p01tfolios. Access to information regarding crowded positions help investors understand how similar their holdings are to the portfolios managed by institutional managers with similar investment styles/strategies. However, under the proposal, the absence of fewer numbers of 13F filings and filers will hinder the ability of investors to understand and assess crowding risks, resulting in obscurity and unce1tainty for investors, issuers, and the capital markets. 4 See NIRI Letter to the SEC 5 See hltps://,vw,v.sec.gov/news/pub1ic-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10 6 See https: / / ipreo,com /blog/ secs-13 f-proposal-issuer-and-investor-analysis/. 7 See https://w,vw.sec.gov/files/ 480.pdf citing Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94-75 at 78 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U .S.C.C.A.N. 179, 261. See also Division oflnvestment Management: Frequently Asked Questions About Form 13F (May 2005)(Frequently Asked Questions), http://www.sec.gov/divsions /investment/13ffaq.htm) Question 1 at p.1 (""Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States securities markets.""). 2 Brokers Win, Investors Lose Brokers, not investors, will emerge as winners in the more opaque market most certain to result from the proposal. After the implementation of MiFID II rules, traditional brokers began to lose relevance as investors started to invest in a more direct manner, thereby avoiding brokerage commissions. At the same time, investor relations officers started to focus their outreach and capital raising efforts on sponsored research firms/paid advocates, employees, dealers, vendors and others to actively and directly market their company to and raise capital from investors. However, if the proposal is adopted, companies that currently rely on 13F filings to seek marketing and capital growth insights and opportunities will again become largely dependent on brokers to close the information and engagement gap, In tum, we believe that this will lead to higher brokerage commissions and ultimately hinder the growth and efficiency of our capital markets. More Expensive Access to More Limited Information for Companies We believe that access to data will become more limited and more expensive if the proposal is adopted. The Commission stated that the new reporting threshold would retain data ""on over 90% of the dollar value of the securities currently reported.""8 However, the information void that will be created by the proposal due to the lack of reporting by over 90% of the current 13F filers will mean that the cost of accessing that previously available information will increase, and those increased costs will ultimately be borne by the public companies seeking out that information and in tum bome by investors and the capital markets as a whole, For example, the cost to companies that utilize shareholder surveillance services in an effmt to obtain timely and detailed data regarding the transaction activity of investment managers will increase, as these service providers currently rely on 13F filings to produce that data. Similarly, companies seeking to obtain a list of their registered shareholders and non-objecting beneficial owners (NOBO) will have more difficulty accessing this information due to more limited publicly available data that would result from the proposals and likely will need to pay more for that information as a result. 9 Damages Investor Relations and Ultimately Capital Markets Our investor relations team seeks to ""know our cnstomer,"" with the customer in this ease being investors and other market participants. If companies do not understand their investors or worse are unable to ascertain who their investors are, companies will be unable to improve disclosures, and better communicate with and otherwise help their investors. Investors and other market participants want companies to provide them with more, and better, information, transparency and communications. Indeed, the efficiency of our capital markets depends on the timely public dissemination of accurate information about issuers and their securities, and the Commission has recently and historically called for more transparency with investors, paiticularly during times of market uncertainty. Companies will be unable to do that if they are unable to readily identify their investors and evaluate investor activity and behavior. 10 Companies certainly will be unable, or less able, to do that if the proposals are adopted. We believe this will not only negatively impact public companies but the capital markets as a whole, as described below, 8 See https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-152 9 See https: / /www.intro-act.com/# /fundamentals/Mjk- 10 See https:/lwww.intro-act.com/# /fundamentals/MzE= 3 Since the Commission's Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies in which they invest. Investors now engage more directly with issuers on many impo1tant matters, including capital allocation decisions, long-term strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to seek to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most important duties of our investor relations team is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C-suite executives or directors. Most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available, to properly engage with investors. However, the Commission's proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust investor relations engagement that has developed by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long-term basis. While companies would continue to receive information from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each qumter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is more important. Small and mid-cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. Additional discussion about these topics follows. Harms Retail Investors Retail investors often will place reliance on a company's 13F data when they make investment decisions. With the proposal, these investors will have far less information with which to make such decisions, and information that would remain available can be deceiving, pmtieularly as it pertains to micro-and small-cap companies. For example, the 13F filings associated with a micro-cap company could make it appear to an investor that the company has no institutional ownership whatsoever, when that might not actually be the case. As one investor relations professional recently noted, a significant concern regarding the proposal is a potential degrading of investor trust in the micro/small cap markets. He pointed out that these issuers likely do not have a roster oflarge ($3.6B and up) institutional investment managers yet: Decreasing transparency for the smaller institutions significantly harms micro/small caps in their ability to know who's holding their stock, while giving the impression that they have no institutional following. u In our view, more and more retail investors are seeking to access the capital markets without the assistance of an intermediary and further seek to invest in ""stmt-ups"", i.e., micro-cap and small cap companies. Harms the Most Vulnerable Issuers and Investors IHS Markit analyzed the 3000 largest companies in the United States to identify which issuers 11 See https://www.intro-act.com/# /fundamentals/MzE= 4 and investors would be most affected by the increase of the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion: • In terms of issners, IHS Marldt found that micro-cap, small-cap and energy companies would be most severely affected by the resulting loss of information access, while mega­ cap, large-cap and utilities companies would see the least impact. • In terms of institutional managers/investors, IHS Markit found that the proposal would noticeably impact alternative/specialty and active/high turnover institutional investment managers in terms of relief from filing requirements, while index/low turnover managers would see little relief from their filing requirements. On average, 55% of the investors, and 69% of the hedge fund investors, on an issuer's shareholder list would no longer be the subject of 13F filings. • Impo1tantly, IHS Marldt analyzed the impact on ""activist"" institutional investment managers and found that an incredible 86% of activist managers would no longer be required to file 13Fs.12 Activists tend to build concentrated positions and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3.5 billion. This could lead to an even greater rise in activist managers, leading to significant disruptions to the capital markets and to public companies.1s Additional discussion regarding activists follows. Increases Activism Risks Just as there is a need for greater transparency on the pait of public companies with their investors, a company's need for ownership data is even greater during times of market volatility and unce1tainty, when many activist investors seek to take advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, public companies would be unable to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus allowing them to ""game the system"" and use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and to the detriment of the company's long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes public companies to a greater risk of ambush activism by shmt-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that the company eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the company's long-term strategy or the investment strategy of its long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 97 proxy contests were launched.14 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another snrge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the Commission's proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors. In sum, without the 13F data that is available now, companies will not know if an activist manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the 13D disclosure threshold is crossed and publicly smfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Fmther, unless and until the 13D requirements are updated to, among other things, include directors, activists can mask their holdings until it is too late for the company to defend itself. 12 See https: / / ipreo.corn /blog /secs~ 13f-proposal ~issuer-and-investor-a nalvsis 13 See https: / [tpreo,com/blog/secs-13f-proposal-issuer-and-investor-analysis/ 14 See https://ne\\'s.bloomberglaw.com/corporate-governance/insight-preparing-for-post-pandemic-corporate­ activism 5 Negatively Im11acts Capital Formation and Markets The loss of 13F data also would impede a company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach effo1ts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies to effectively access the capital markets, communicate with potential investors and to grow their businesses. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency regarding who is holding as well as buying a company's equity securities each qumter would hinder the company's ability to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the Commission should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Unlikely Reduction in Cost Bnrden We understand that the Commission aims to reduce the cost burden and provide relief to smaller managers who are currently subject to 13F repmting. 1s According to Commission estimates, the direct compliance costs per manager can range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually and the proposal can result in savings of $68 million to $136 million in addition to savings in indirect costs related to 13F users front-running or copying advisers' portfolios.16 However, in our experience, the estimates appear to be quite high. Form 13F filings generally are an automated process for investment managers."" Accordingly, we echo Commissioner Lee's views regarding the cost analysis in the proposal. 18 Lack of Regulatory Authority We, like Commissioner Lee, question the Commission's authority to increase the rep01ting threshold. The statute itself provides no supp01t for such an increase, and in fact appears to set a statutory reporting threshold of $100 million, while authorizing the Commission to lower it, not increase it. The proposing release does not address this, and simply concludes that the statute provides the Commission with the authority to increase the threshold. Fmther, in our view, any use of the exemptive authority in Section 13(£)(3) would be inconsistent with the limitation on the Commission's authority in Section 13(£)(1). In other words, the Commission would be using its exemptivc authority to turn the statute on its head. For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer-investor engagement.

BIO represents nearly 1,000 companies and firms in the biotechnology industry across the United States . Our members are responsible for innovating the next generation of treatments, diagnostics, and cures that will secure the health and safety of our Nation . Even in today’s uncertain times, America’s small biotechnology (biotech) companies, both public and private, continue to lead efforts to address the most devastating health risks and diseases in the world. In fact, 76% of all global research and developme nt (R&D) aimed at tackling the COVID -19 pandemic is generated by small biotech companies.1 Small biotech companies are also responsible for 80% of all scientific R&D.2 Almost all of these companies started as a revolutionary idea in a laboratory that was nurtured by private market financing, such as exempt offerings. The Importance of Investor Position ing Data As the Commission noted in their proposed rulemaking3, the original intent of the 13 (f) filings , which were added as part of the Amendments of 1975, was to elucidate “information about the purchase, sale, and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors” and was design ed to capture a sufficiently large percentage of assets under management while minimizing the total number of reporting managers . BIO believes that the current proposal strikes against the spirit of the law , particularly when it comes to speciali st investment managers such as those that are instrumental to the success of the biotechnology industry . 1 https://www.bio.org/policy/human -health/vaccines -biodefense/coronavirus/therapeutic - development/bio -covid-19-therapeutic -development -tracker 2 https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the -iqvia-institute/reports/emerging -biopharmas -contribution -to- innovation 3 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34 -89290.pdf In the proposal , SEC Staff interpret the three primary goals of the 13(f) section of the 1975 Amendments as (1) to create a database of the investment activities of institutions, (2) to improve the body of data regarding the holdi ngs of institutions in an effort to better understand the influence and impact of institutions on securities markets, and (3) to increase investor confidence in the U.S. equity market. BIO contends that the proposal, as written undercuts all three goals and is inconsistent with the overall intent of the 13(f) amendments. Over the last 45 years, as the equity markets became more transparent and the democratization of market data increased , corporate managers harnessed 13(f) filings to inform decision -making across various corporate verticals . This information provide s a vital service to corporate planners , especially in emerging growth and smaller reporting companies , who seek to understand and engage with their existing shareholders while also target ing their desired investor base as they plot their growth strategies . Every corporate executive wants investors that believe in his/her company’s mission, vision, values, and product pipeline ; and are willing to stay invested through all the ups and downs that occur along the way . This is especially true in biotechnology where products take more than a decade to come to market and have a high probability of receiving FDA questions and delays along the way , which brings volatility to stock prices . These long and uncertain product pipelines make it hard for shares of small biotechnology companies to be included in exchange -traded funds and mutual funds and leaves them exposed to the volatility of short -term traders and activists. It, therefore, becomes instrumental for biotechnology corporate planners to carefully monitor changes in shareholder structure, while harnessing peer group data to research , engage, and pursue the specialist investors that truly un derstand biotechnology investments. BIO contends that raising the threshold for 13 (f) filing from $100 million to $3.5 billion will completely eradicate the decades -old practice of leveraging 13 (f) information content for the biotechnology industry’s corporate managers to better understand and engage with their shareholders, and for corporate planners to create peer benchmarks to plot their path to institutional investor holdings. Recommendation Do not raise the 13(f)-reporting threshold to the equity market growth -adjusted level of $3.5 billion as this will eliminate 70% of the information content provided by healthcare specialist investment advisors and asset managers. These data are critical for corporate planning and decision -making purposes, which have been refined over the last few decades. Even raising the threshold to the inflation -adjusted level of $450 million will eliminate 50% of healthcare -specialist fund managers that are vital to emerging biotechnology companies. Discussion BIO supports the SEC’s path of streamlining disclosure and reporting regulations to lower the burden s of market participants and companies. To date, BIO has supported a great number of the SEC’s initiatives that broadened access for Main Stre et investors, enhanced capital formation and reduced costs for small companies, and leveled the playing field between market participants and corporations. However, in this instance, BIO believes that the policy arguments and economic analysis underpinnin g this proposed rulemaking are inconsistent with the spirit of the SEC’s recent policy path , are diminishing rather than enhanc ing transparency , and are creating unintended consequence s, damaging Main Street investors as well as hav ing deleterious effects on corporate planning, particularly in healthcare. BIO vehemently opposes the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, an equity market - adjustment, an inflation -adjustment, and a flow of funds -adjustment of the existing threshold as doing so would create catastrophic information asymmetries in the healthcare secto r, negatively affect investor confidence, and completely erode decades -old corporate planning practices. The Signal from the Noise Biotechnology entrepreneurs, as with any other company in the business of innovation, rely on specialist investors to financ e their niche endeavors. When these biotechnology entrepreneurs are looking forward, attempting to treat a myriad of ailments or tackling the various problems that society faces , they rely on the long -term perspective and understanding of specialist invest ors that are willing to finance the long pipelines and volatile path of translating scientific discovery into novel product s. Knowing when and how to target these investors is crucial for biotechnology corporate planners to formulate funding strategies t hat are often project ed several years forward. This entire planning process has been instrumental in financing innovation for decades. 13(f) data have been at the core of these efforts. Planning the Road Ahead With these data, planners can better understand the investor landscape that is not easily apparent or readily available . Where th e data are easily apparent or readily available , they come at an expensive premium from third party database providers. Most biotechnology startups that enter publi c markets do so with the singular focus of raising capital to further develop their treatments, and do not have the discretionary capital to allocate to these database providers . Biotechnology investor relations and corporate finance professional s have for decades harnessed 13 (f) data to formulate peer benchmarking, which is the process by which new entrants into financial markets glean insights from similar companies that have already navigated these hurdles. These 13 (f) data help corporate planners und erstand the landscape, construct peer benchmarks , and further understand an investor’s preferences for research and development stage (e.g. does Investor X tend to invest in Pre -Clinical companies), preferences for therapeutic areas (e.g. does Investor X f ocus on oncology therapeutics or are they agnostic), average holding period (e.g. does Investor X only hold through clinical trials phases and then exits once a product is introduced to market), and portfolio concentration (e.g. is Investor A overly expose d to oncology). Together, company planners can understand which investors to approach for which stages of corporate and product lifecycle as they synthesize a long -term financial strategy. Emerging oncology companies that are planning to file an S -1 in 12 months now have a roadmap for investor engagement and what to expect in various scenarios. Innovation is a capital intensive process, and the idiosyncrasies of investor mandates and risk limit the opportunity set , requir ing a great degree of effort in understanding the landscape and pursuing the right investors at the right time who can understand the scientific pursuit, appreciate the goals, and have the necessary risk tolerance for each stage of growth. Ultimately, every company wants long -term inv estors, such as financial institutions that package shares into mutual funds and exchange -traded funds . But these investors are earned over time with consistent execution and proper diligence. This entire process begins and ends with 13 (f) filing data. Using 13 (f) data accumulated and sorted by WhaleWisdom4 BIO scraped 13 (f) data to find over 100 investors that are concentrated in the healthcare space. Many of these investors are established names with whom many biotechs are familiar, and many are smaller, niche players that were only known to member companies with personnel that have operated in the selected space for a long time. As the chart below illustrates, the median assets under management (AUM) for specialist healthcare investors is $413 million, which is significantly below the SEC’s intended threshold of $3.5 billion and below the inflation -adjusted threshold of $450 million. If the SEC proceeds as planned, the biotechnology industry will lose 70% of the information content that these filings historical ly supplied. And because of the skew of the distribution of AUM in the healthcare investor sector, we also find that adjusting the threshold by inflation would similarly remove 50% of the information content that has been historically supplied by 13 (f) filings. 4 https://whalewisdom.com/ As many respondents have noted already, this lack of transparency will be deleterious to Main Street investors and to the biotechnology industry, in particular, as it relie s heavily on these data to plan financing and investor targeting strategie s. Investor Engagement and Activist Monitoring Just as with seeking to plan a company’s financial forward path, company managers must also carefully monitor and engage with existing shareholders. Understanding the composition of existing shareholder s allows corporate representatives the ability to create strategic communications to address shareholder questions and concerns. This enables more fruitful interactions between management and shareholder while also ensuring th at company executives’ time is used wisely and efficiently on behalf of the Board and shareholders . Moreover, understanding the current composition of shareholders is necessary when it comes to the positioning of known activist investors. It is critical to be able to see the accumulating po sition of known activists so that corporate managers can engage, understand priorities, solicit feedback, and resolve differences over time in order to avoid costly proxy fights down the road . BIO understands that the presence of activists in the market is necessary and, in certain cases, beneficial to shareholder return. However, in many cases, these returns are short - term in nature and sacrifice long -term plans. It is necessary to engage with activists early on to better understand and bridge differences . The alignment of all stakeholders and the management of risks (including operational, financial, and legal risks) are all critical components of sound corporate governance, which, in part, relies on good data. Raising the reporting threshold as proposed will erode this aspect of sound governance and management, and may lead to higher corporate costs, such as legal fees to fight proxy battles and director and officer (D&O) insurance costs as companies will not be able to sufficiently mitigate ris ks. Biotechnology companies already face structurally higher D&O costs due to the legal asymmetries that exist between the risks and uncertainties inherent in the scientific discovery process and shareholder class action lawsuit rights granted by states . The inability to adequately mitigate potential proxy fights with activists (legal liability) may inadvertently raise D&O costs for companies that need every dollar to advance critical research and development for novel therapeutics. Conclusion BIO conten ds that the Commission should not raise the reporting threshold for 13 (f) filings as this would erode existing corporate decision -making process in place for decades that are instrumental to planning and investor engagement. As shown in the discussion, rai sing the threshold to $3.5 billion would eradicate 70% of healthcare specialist investors who, given their focus in understanding healthcare sector peculiarities, are critical partners in the decades -long product planning process undertaken by every biotec hnology company domiciled in the United States. Raising the threshold would be deleterious to the financial planning that has been characteristic of the innovation economy. Moreover, raising the threshold may have the unintended consequence of raising cost s for biotechnology companies who are among the most target by litigious and activist investors. BIO looks forward to working with the SEC on these important issues. If we can provide further information regarding these comments, please contact me at cpa sseri@bio.org . Outstanding SEC Questions Following, please find BIO’s responses to select SEC Staff’s questions on the proposal that were not addressed in our discussion above . 8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? BIO contends that filing 13(f) forms is not uniquely burdensome among the numerous reporting burdens imposed upon small managers, and thus relief from 13(f) filings alone will not provide meaningful burden reduction. A dedicated regulatory reporting or compliance specialist is a salaried, full -time employee typically responsible for filing all regulatory filings. Removing a single filing will not save operating costs associated with this one employee. In the event that the small firm outsources compliance to consultant s, as is the common practice, service contracts are typically fixed -cost, annual amounts with statements of work that include a variety of routine regulatory filings. Removing the 13(f) form would not materially change fixed -cost service contracts in this regard as ongoing filings are numerous. 9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? In healthcare, the median investor AUM is $413 million with a mean of $300 million. Small manager reporting is necessary for the smooth functioning of this niche market as specialist funds tend to be small. These investors tend to engage in more fruitful discussions with manage ment, have the appropriate risk tolerance, and possess a more sophisticated knowledge base for the sciences and technologies being developed by innovators in the space.

Via email to: rule-comments@sec.gov Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Subject: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Commission 's proposed amendments to 17 CFR 240.13f-1 (""rule 13f-1 "") and Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""). PotlatchDeltic Corporation (""PotlatchDe ltic"" or ""the Company "") is a Real Estate Investment Trust (""REIT"") that owns approximate ly 1.8 million acres of timberlands and operates six sawmills, an industrial-grade plywood mill, a residential and commerc ial real estate development business and a rural timberland sales program. PotlatchDeltic 's market capitalizatio n is approximately $3 billion. We do not support the proposal to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion. As discussed in more detail below: • Such a change would significant ly erode the effectiveness of our shareholder outreach; • The negative effects clearly outweigh the benefits; and • It does not appear that the Commission has the statutory authority to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold. Shareholder Outreach Effective shareholder outreach is an important part of our strategy focused on increasing the value of our shares over the long term and is aligned with the Commission 's mission to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and to facilitate capital formation. Conversations with existing and prospective shareholders are a key input to their investment decisions through discussion of the Company 's strategy and its alignment with industry fundamentals , our relative competitive position, and our capital allocation strategy and priorities. PotlatchDeltic Corporation 601 West First Avenue, Suite 1600 Spokane, WA 99201 PotlatchDeltic.com Ms. Countryman Page 2 September 14, 2020 The prerequisite to having appropriate conversations and to make efficient use of limited management time is accurate shareholder information. That includes information about shareholdings in competitors, the sector, and similar size companies in addition to information about PotlatchDeltic's shareholders . The only accurate source of institutional holdings available is Form 13F filings. Schedules 13D and 13G and Form N-PORT reports, which were cited by the Commission as alternate sources for some of the information reported in Form 13F, are not adequate replacements because they either apply only to holdings greater than five percent in a registrant or to registered management investment companies, and such information is publicly available only on a delayed basis. Holders of less than five percent of our shares represent some of our more active and engaged shareholders. As a mid-cap company, PotlatchDeltic would be disproportionately affected by the proposed 35- fold increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold . Based on an analysis as of March 31, 2020, we_ would lose visibility to the holdings of 95 of our active shareholders representing 36.5% of active shareholders that filed a Form 13F and the 13% of Company shares held by the group. As a result, the proposal would lead to a significant loss of market transparency of our holders which is not in the public interest. The proposed revision to the Form 13F reporting threshold would also allow a significant number of the most prolific activist hedge funds to cease filing Form 13F. This increases the risk that PotlatchDeltic and other companies could be subjected to activist campaigns focused on short-term objectives at the expense of long-term value creation and the orderly and efficient operation of capital markets. A 35-fold increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold would significantly decrease the effectiveness of our shareholder outreach efforts, which in turn would constrain our access to the capital markets and our ability to grow the Company. In addition, the proposal would increase the risk that we would be subjected to a disruptive and expensive activist campaign that is not in the interest of our long-term shareholders. Cost vs. Benefit Analysis As the only accurate source of institutional holdings available, use of 13F data has expanded well beyond the original intended purpose. While acknowledging that ""the pool of users have expanded to include academics, market researchers , the media, attorneys pursuing private securities class action matters, and market participants (including institutional investors themselves) who use the data to enhance their ability to compete, "" Release 34-89290 did not provide an assessment of the effect that a change in the Form 13F reporting threshold would Ms. Countryman Page 3 September 14, 2020 have on that pool of users. This is a glaring gap that needs to be addressed prior to implementing any change in the reporting threshold. Release 34-89290 stated that the proposal would decrease the cost incurred by a small manager by an estimated $15,000 to $30,000 annually. Multiple commenters, including Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, have called into question the veracity of the Commission 's cost estimates . This issue needs to be addressed prior to implementing any change in the reporting threshold. Front-running and copycatting were both cited as negative effects of the current $100 million Form 13F reporting threshold . Given that Form 13Fs are not due until 45 days after the end of each quarter, it is not clear to us how either front-running or copycatting are exacerbated by the current Form 13F reporting threshold. We believe that the argument is disingenuous at best. Given the Commission's overarching mission to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and to facilitate capital formation , the effect on constituents that rely on Form 13F information needs to be considered rather than narrowly focusing on the original intent of the legislation that established Form 13F reporting requirements in 1975. The cost-benefit analysis associated with the proposed change stated in Release 34-89290 is incomplete and does not support the change recommended by the Commission. Commission Authority As has been pointed out by others, including the dissenting statement from Commissioner Herren Lee, it appears that the Commission does not have the statutory authority to increase the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers . The Exchange Act states the following in Section 13(f)(1 ): Every institutional investment manager which uses the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in the course of its business as an institutional investment manager and which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of this title having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe , but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter. [emphasis added] The pertinent language in the Exchange Act indicates that the Commission has the authority to establish a reporting threshold lower than $100 million, but not to increase the reporting Ms. Countryman Page 4 September 14, 2020 threshold. Release No. 34-89290 did not address the statutory authority question or provide rationale on why the Commission believes it has the authority to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold. The apparent conflict needs to be resolved before implementing any increase to the Form 13F reporting threshold. * * * * * We support efforts to modernize the Form 13F reporting regime. We believe that the Commission should withdraw the proposal to increase the Form 13F reporting threshold 35-fold and encourage the Commission to consider the rule-making petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the Society for Corporate Governance , NYSE and Nasdaq.1·2·3 Your consideration is appreciated.

We also believe that the Commission should eliminate the ability of beneficial owners of a company to p rohibit their intermediaries from disclosing their identity to such comp any. 2 As proposed, the current reporting threshold would increase from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We believe that this change would have a dramatic and negative impact on public companies and the capital markets. To that end, we echo ICR’s and NIRI’s comments as set out in their letter s to the Commission , dated August 25, 2020 and August 26, 20204 respectively, as well as Commissioner Lee’s comments in her statement regarding the proposal dated July 10, 2020 .5 In addition, we offer the following views regarding the proposal . Significant ly Reduc es Access to Public Information and M arket Transparency If the proposed threshold is adopted, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers or 90% of current 13F filers – representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets – will no longer be required to file Form 13F.6 We understand that the proposed threshold is based on the growth of the U.S. equities market between 1975 and December 2018. While the Commission estimates that the increased threshold would retain disclosure for approximately 75% of the dollar va lue of the U.S. equities market , the transparency on that dollar value is greatly different no w given the change in investment strategies since then, i.e., the rise in passive/index investing as compared to active investment strategies. Under the proposal, mostly index and passiv e investing will continue to be reported, which does not provide the same transparency as tracking active and activist investing. Further, t he proposed threshold does not reflect the value of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, which would be near $500 m illion, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We believe that the proposal , if adopted , will significantly and detrimentally r educe information access and market transparency, which in turn will result in reduced investor confidence and capital market efficiencie s (particularly for smaller capitalization companies) , and further will provide a disincentive for privately owned companies to go public . When Congress first adopted Section 13( f) in 1975, it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” 7 However, the current proposal is antithetical to that legislative intent and will have the opposite effect on public companies and our capital markets , the efficiency of and the confidence in which is wholly dependent on information access and transparency . Cloud s Crowding Risk The proposal will create a l ack of clarity regarding crowding risk due to fewer hedge fund manager filings. Investors use 13F filings of top hedge fund managers to understand crowding risk and in turn to appropriately hedge their portfolios. Access to information regarding c rowded positions help investors understand how similar their holdings are to the portfolios managed by institutional managers with similar investment styles/strategies. However, under the proposal , the absence of fewer number s of 13F filings and filers will hinder the ability of inves tors to understand and assess crowding risks, resulting in obscurity and uncertainty for investors , issuers, and the capital markets . 4 See NIRI Letter to the SEC , and ICR’s Letter to the SEC 5 See https://www.sec.gov/news/public -statement/lee- 13f-reporting -2020 -07-10 6 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ . 7 See https://www.sec.gov/files/480.pdf citing Report of Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94 -75 at 78 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 179, 261. See also Division of Investment Management: Frequently Asked Questions About For m 13F (May 2005)(Frequently Asked Questions), http://www.sec.gov/divsions /investment/13ffaq.htm, Question 1 at p.1 (“Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States secu rities markets.”). 3 Brokers Win, Investors Lose Brokers , not investors, will emerge as winners in the more opaque market most certain to resul t from the proposal. After the implementation of MiFID II rules, traditional brokers began to los e relevance as investors started to invest i n a more direct manner, thereby avoiding broker age commissions. At the same time, investor relations officers started to focus their outreach and capital raising efforts on sponsored research firms/ paid advocates, employees, dealers, vendors and others to actively and directly market their company to and raise capital from investors. However, if the propos al is a dopted , companies that currently rely on 13F filings to seek marketing and capital growth insights and opportunities will again become largely dependent on brokers to close the information and engagement gap . In turn, we believe that t his will lead to high er brokerage commissions and ultimately hinder the growth and efficiency of our capital markets . More Expensive Access to More Limited Information for Companies We believe that a ccess to data will be come more limited and more expensive if the proposal is adopted . The Commission stated that the new reporting threshold would retain data “on over 90% of the dollar value of the securities currently reported.”8 However, the information void that will be created by the proposal due to the lack of reporting by over 90% of the current 13F filers will mean that the cost of accessing that previously available information will increase, and those increased costs will ultimately be borne by the public companies seeking ou t that information and in turn borne by investors and the capital markets as a whole . For example, the cost to companies that utilize shareholder surveillance services in an effort to obtain timely and detailed data regarding the transaction activity of investment managers will increase, as these service providers currently rely on 13F filings to produce that data . Similarly, companies seeking to obtain a list of their registered shareholders and non- objecting beneficial owners (NOBO) will have more diffic ulty accessing this information due to more limited publicly available data that would result from the proposals and likely will need to pay more for that information as a result. 9 Damages Investor Relations and Ultimately Capital Markets Our i nvestor relations team seek s to “know our customer ,” with the customer in this case being investors and other market participants. If companies do not understand their investors or worse are unable to ascertain who their investors are, companies will be unable to improve disclosures , and better communicate with and otherwise help their investors. Investors and other market participants want companies to provide them with more, and better, information, transparency and communications. Indeed, the efficiency of our capital markets depends on the timely public dissemination of accurate information about issuers and their securities, and the Commission has recently and historically called for more transparency with investors, particularly during times of market uncertainty. Companies will be unable to do that if they are unable to readily identify their investors and evaluate investor activity and behavior. 10 Companies certainly will be unable, or less able , to do that if the proposals are adopted. We believe this will not only negatively impact public companies but the capital markets as a whole , as described below. Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between institutional investors and the public companies in which they invest. Investors now engage more directly with issuers on many important matters, 8 See https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152 9 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/Mjk = 10 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/MzE = 4 including capital allocation decisions, long -term strategy, mergers an d acquisitions , and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to seek to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most importa nt duties of our investor relations team is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C -suite executives or directors. Most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate s ource available , to properly engage with investors. However, t he Commission’s proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust investor relations engagement that has developed b y excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. Thes e managers include hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long -term basis. While companies would continue to receive infor mation from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion t hreshold that is more important . Small and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency. Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one o f those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. Additional discussion about these topics follows. Harms Retail Investors Retail investors often will place reliance on a company’s 13F data when they m ake investment decisions. With the proposal, these investors will have far less information with which to make such decisions, and information that would remain available can be deceiving, particularly as it pertains to micro - and small -cap companies. For example, the 13F filings associated with a micro - cap company could make it appear to an investor that the company has no institutional ownership whatsoever, when that might not actually be the case. As one investor relations professional recently noted , a significant concern regarding the proposal is a potential degrading of investor trust in the micro/small cap market s. He pointed out that these issuers likely do not have a roster of large ($3.6B and up) institution al investment managers yet: Decreasing transparency for the smaller institutions significantly harms micro/small caps in their ability to know who’s holding their stock, while giving the impression that they h ave no institutional following. 11 In our view, more and more retail investo rs are seeking to access the capital markets without the assistance of an intermediary and further seek to invest in “start- ups”, i.e., micro -cap and small cap companies. Harm s the Most Vulnerable Issuers and Investors IHS Markit analyzed the 3000 largest companies in the United States to identify which issuers and investors would be most affected by the increase of the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion: 11 See https://www.intro -act.com/#/fundamentals/MzE = 5 • In terms of issuers, I HS Markit found that micro -cap, small -cap and energy companies would be most severely affected by the resulting loss of information access , while mega - cap, large -cap and utilities companies would see the least impact. • In terms of in stitutional managers /investors , IHS Markit found that the proposal would noticeably impact alternati ve/specialty and active/ high turnover institutional investment managers in terms of relief from filing requirements , while index /low turnover managers would see little relief from their filing requirements . On average, 55% of the investors, and 69% of the hedge fund investors, on an issuer’s shareholder list would no longer be the subject of 13F filings. • Importantly, IHS Markit analyzed the impact on “ activist” institutional investment managers and found that an incredible 86% of activist managers would no longer be required to file 13Fs .12 Activists tend to build concentrated positions and thus many could still build notable positions with less than $3.5 billion . This could lead to an even greater rise in activist managers, leading to significant disruptions to the capital markets and to public companies.13 Additional discussion regarding activists follows. Increase s Activism Risks Just as there is a need for greater transparency on the part of public companies with their investors, a company’s need for ownership data is even greater during times of market volatility and uncertainty, when many activist investors seek to take advantag e of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, public companies would be unable to monitor activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus allowing the m to “gam e the system” and use the increased lack of transpa rency for their benefit and to the detriment of the company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes public compan ies to a greater risk of ambu sh activism by short- term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that the company eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of the company’s long -term strategy or the investment strategy o f its long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 97 proxy contests were launched.14 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the Commission ’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency w ould be especially unfortunate for companies and long - term investors. In sum, without the 13F data that is available now, companies will not know if an activist manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 day s after the 13D disclosure threshold is crossed and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Further, unless and until the 13D requirements are updated to, among other things, include directors, activists can mask their holdings until it is too late for the company to defend itself. Negative ly Impact s Capital Formation and Markets The loss of 13F data also would impede a company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, companies use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders 12 See https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis 13 See https:// ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor -analysis/ 14 See https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post -pandemic- corporate - activism 6 (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for companies to effectively access the capital markets, communicate with potential investors and to grow their businesses. Under the propo sed threshold, the loss of transparency regarding who is holding as well as buying a company’s equity securities each quarter would hinder the company’s ability to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the Commission should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Unlikely Reduction in Cost Burden We understand that the Commission aims to reduce the cost burden and provide relief to smaller managers who are currently subject to 13F reporting. 15 According to Commission estimates, the direct compliance costs per manager can range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually and the proposal can result in savings of $68 million to $136 million in addition to savings in ind irect costs related to 13F users front- running or copying advisers’ portfolios.16 However, in our experience, the estimates appear to be quite high . Form 13F filings generally are an automated process for investment managers.17 Accordingly, we echo Commis sioner Lee’s views regarding the cost analysis in the proposal.18 Lack of Regulatory Authority We, like Commission er Lee, question the Commission ’s authority to increase the reporting threshold . The statute itself provides no support for such an increas e, and in fact appears to set a statutory reporting threshold of $100 million, while authorizing the Commission to lower it , not increase it . The proposing release does not address this, and simply concludes that the statute provides the Commission with the authority to increase the threshold. Further, in our view, any use of the exemptive authority in Section 13(f)(3) would be inconsistent with the limitation on the Commission’s au thority in Section 13(f)(1) . In oth er words, the Commission would be using its exemptive authority to turn the statute on its head . For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35 -times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by ICR, NIR I and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer- investor engagement.

(“Dow” ) is grateful for the opportunity to comment on the proposal to update the Form 13F reporting requirements for institutional investment managers set forth in the abov e-referenced release (the “Proposed Amendment”) . INTRODUCTION As discussed further below in this letter, we respectfully request the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) to consider the impact of the Proposed Amendment on: • Shareholder engagement and market transparency . The 35-times proposed increase in the Form 13F reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion would result in a reduction in nearly 90% of the current filers across the broader market . A reduction of this magnitude will adversely impac t the ability of issuers to meaningfully engage with shareholders and reduce access of market participants to valuable information. We believe the current threshold of $100 million should be maintained, or a more modest increase consistent with inflation would be appropriate . U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 11, 2020 Page 2 • The scope and timing of reporting requirements . The Proposed Amendment , with appropriate modifications, presents an opportunity to truly modernize the reporting timeframe and implement a shorter filing period than the outdat ed 45-day window . This can be accomplished by adjusting the reporting frequency to a monthly cadence and shorten the current 45-day filing window to 15 days . Further, Section 13( f) securities should be expanded to more comprehensively cover derivatives and short positions . Dow agrees that the relevant regulations are due for an update, but should be modified and implemented in a comprehensive and thoughtful manner. IMPACT ON ISSUER /SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MARKET TRANSPARENCY Reduced Shareholder Engagement Dow has consistently supported the Commission’s efforts to improve transparency and effective engagement with shareholders. Against that backdrop, the Commission’s recommendation to eliminate the omission of the Form 13F reporting threshold for individual securities, and also require managers to provide additional identifying information, are welcome d. However, we believe that the increase in the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion would significantly limit many companies’, including Dow’s, ability to proactive ly seek direct engagement with a majority of institutional owners that own its securities . Further, for many companies, including Dow, the Form 13F data from more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold is highly relevant and valuable. The Proposed Amendment would result in only one-third of Dow owner s currently reporting their holding in the company throug h Form 13F continuing to do so. Consequently , at the time the existing rules were adopted more than 4 5 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between public companies and institutional investors. Companies rely on Form 13F disclosures as they engag e with a wider range of owners and work to ensure that the inquiries and/or concerns across its shareholder base are appropriately conveyed to and considered by senior executives and directors. Based on the foregoing , we respectfully request the Commission consider a more modest change based on the consumer price index which would be consistent with other recent adjustments, such U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 11, 2020 Page 3 as the increases to the public float thresholds for an accelerated filer (from $50 million to $60 million) and for large accelerated status (from $500 million to $560 million) .1 Although the proposed release states that the new threshold would retain the disclosure of more than 90% of the value of the holdings that are currently reported, many of the institutional managers with whom Dow has sought to engage over the last year would no longer be required to report its holdings on Form 13F . We believe this form of engagement is beneficial to investors in Dow – and to the market more generally – and has really become the true investor benefit that has resulted from the Form 13F reporting regime. Diminishe d Market Transparency From an overall investor perspective, raising the Form 13F threshold would adversely impact retail investors and small asset managers as many rely on this data to help inform their investment decisions . To that end, i t is relevant to note that the introduction of Section 13(f) into the Securities Exchange Act by Congress was intended to improve transparency for all market participants and increase investor confidence in U.S. securities markets. As the Commission states, “The laws and rules that govern the securities industry in the United States derive from a simple and straightforward concept: all investors, whether large institutions or private individua ls, should have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to buying it, and so long as they hold it. [ …] The result of this information flow is a far more active, efficient, and transparent capital market that facilitates the capital formation so important to our nation's economy.”2 More broadly across all issuers, the Proposed Rule would eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing approximately $2.3 trillion in assets. Many of these managers have become more active in engaging with issuers on matters such as capital allocation decisions and long -term strategy to assess potential changes in their shareholding. Furthermore, there is broad recognition that new uses of the Form 13F data have developed among academics and market researchers, whose insights are a valuable contribution for both issuers and investors. Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request that the Commission modify the reporting threshold as set forth above . 1 Using the consumer price index as a basis for an adjustment would be aligned with the 2006 review of the Section 13(f) reporting threshold by the Office of Economic Analysis, which considered an elevation of the threshold to $300 million. 2 https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 11, 2020 Page 4 OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE AND ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY Enhanc ed Transparency Through Adjustment of Reporting Periods Timely reporting is directly linked to the transparency the Commission has noted is so important . While Dow recognizes that the current 45-day reporting period for Form 13F was borne of practical considerations for the time required for data collection and submission, we believe these considerations are now less relevant as advances in information technology have significantly expedited these processes . The Commission has long recognized the need to revise reporting obligations to keep up with evolving markets and technology, including, Forms 4, 10-K and 10-Q and Schedules 13. Within that context, increasing frequency of the disclosure requirements would help ensure more complete and timely information is available to promote “a far more active, efficient, and transparent capital market .” Dow respectfully requests that reporting frequency to a monthly cadence and shorten the current 45 -day filing window to 15 days . Expand Scope of Section 13(f) Securities In addition to the shareholder engagement considerations , the Proposed Amendment presents an opportunity to address other , parallel developments in the securities markets significant ly affecting transparency more b roadly. In particular, the emergence and expansion of the market for equity derivative products , which are not wholly covered in the current Form 13F filing requirements, as well as the significant acceleration in stock ownership turnover, which makes the quarterly reporting cadence of institutional ownership data comparatively irregular. 3 We believe the Commission has an opportunity as part of this rulemaking to address these important issues related to the scope of what institutional managers are reporting in 13F filings. CONCLUSION In conclusion, f or the reasons outlined in this letter, Dow respectfully requests that the Commission modify the Proposed Amendment to: (i) modify the reporting threshold based on the consumer price index ; (ii) increase reporting frequency to a monthly cadence and shorten the current 45 -day filing window to 15 days ; and (iii) expand its disclosure require ments to more comprehensively 3 In 2019, the U.S. members and affiliates of the World Federation of Exchanges reported a total 3.9 billion futures and options contracts traded for single stocks and stock indices. This reflects a 44% or 1.2 billion increase in the trade of these types of equity deriva tives over the last decade. Similarly, data from the World Federation of Exchanges also shows that the turnover ratio for domestic shares in the U.S. rose from 69% in 1984 (the first year available in the dataset) to 109% in 2018 (the latest year available in the dataset). U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission September 11, 2020 Page 5 include derivatives and short positions. Dow hopes the Commission will find the se perspectives from an issuer strongly committed to transparency in the U.S. securities markets to be meaningful and constructive, and once again, we thank the Commission for the opportunity to comment on its Proposed Amendment.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (SEC Rel. No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20) Dear Ms. Countryman: Cambridge Associates is a global firm and registered investment adviser that serves endowments, foundations, pension plans, corporations and private clients on both a discretionary and non-discretionary basis. We conduct thorough due diligence on investment managers and build custom portfolios for our clients based on their goals and risk tolerances. I am writing on behalf of Cambridge Associates to express strong opposition to the Commission's proposed amendment of Form 13F, specifically the raising of the reporting threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We understand the need to adjust regulations, however the proposed increase of the 13F reporting threshold not only fails to take into consideration the many changes to investing that have occurred over the past 40 years but also undermines the Commission's tenant of investor protection . Investors rely on 13F data. Over the past four decades, the way that investors participate in the capital markets has changed materially. Today, unlike 40 years ago, endowments, pensions, charities and private families regularly and often allocate a meaningful portion of their investible assets to private investment funds in addition to registered funds. While private investment funds have become institutional, they are not required to provide the same reporting as registered funds, and as a result, there are many more stakeholders that rely on 13F data today than when the rule was first adopted. The proposed $3.5 billion reporting threshold would decrease the usefulness of reported data and subvert the rule's purpose of providing transparency to the public on institutional investment managers . Over the past four decades, the number of institutional investment management firms has significantly increased, and investors often partner with smaller firms who intentionally limit their sizes to align their interests with their investors and maintain prudent liquidity within their funds. In addition, if reporting is limited to institutional investment managers with assets over $3.5 billion, the transparency provided and used by investors to assess manager impact to markets will be distorted given the dramatic increase in the amount of assets managed passively to various indexes by these larger firms. The increased reporting threshold renders the data less useful and affects the ability for investors to manage their portfolios. Securities and Exchange Commission September 11, 2020 page 2 Data provided by the current 13F filings is critical to those responsible for investing capital to fulfil their fiduciary duties as it is an important component for investors to manage a properly balanced portfolio, assess fund managers ' skills, avoid risks stemming from concentration in holdings among funds, avoid paying extra fees from offsetting holdings, and even detect and avoid fraud. The transparency provided by 13F data allows investors to construct more sophisticated and tailored portfolios. We believe this information is so critical to portfolio construction and manager monitoring that investors and allocators will continue to demand such transparency from managers regardless of the amendment. As such, the efficiencies contemplated would likely only flow to the few, highly successful, sought after managers with enough leverage over their investor base to not have to provide transparency; smaller, less established managers would likely have to continue to provide transparency to attract and retain institutional capital. We believe the efficiency gains cited in the proposal are overestimated. The proposed amendment would reallocate the cost of transparency to smaller investment managers and market participants . Moreover, we believe many managers do not view the 13F filing as particularly onerous. The information required for 13F is readily accessible . Fund administrators and custodians regularly include 13F support as part of their services, and many have built out automated processes to streamline reporting. Although some investment managers may experience efficiencies and cost savings, the proposed amendment would certainly increase costs for investors. Investors will spend more time, effort and money collecting and maintaining similar data to procure the current level of transparency they have come to rely on to prudently manage their portfolios. The proposed amendment's purported benefits simply do not outweigh its cost. While we are generally supportive of measures that create more efficient markets and reduce costs to investors, we do not believe the suggested efficiency gains of this proposal outweigh the costs of loss of transparency and access to information for investors. We respectfully ask the Commission to reconsider the adoption of an amendment that would so detrimentally affect investors in the U.S. securities markets.

Chief Financial Officer, Athersys, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7919758-224533.pdf,,"September 1 0, 2020 Jay Clayt on SEC Cha irman R e: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34- 89290; File No. S7-08- 20 Dear Chairman Clayton: On behalf of Athersys, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATHX) , a regenerative medicine company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. W e believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89% of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long- term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. T he 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is t he only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. W e do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a small cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 37% of our current 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter . For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable. 1 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “ SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed-rule-change -step - 193708183.html . ES159621 2 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activi sm but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long- term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use rely on 13F filing data for investor targeting and outreach to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures is also at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. 2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus enabling them to “game the system” and use the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long-term shareholders. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three-part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . .. We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.” Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, ""The Importance of Disclosure – For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID -19,"" April 8, 20 20. ES159621 3 The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short- term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long- term investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or frequently greater ) position. Athersys has been a victim of “short and distort” tactics several times in the past, and this misleading and manipulative behavior deliberately undermines positive market sentiment and hinders the momentum of the Company in order to benefit a hedge fund’s short position in Athersys. We have reported these instances to both FINRA and the SEC and were told that we would not receive updates on these investigations. We strongly request greater transparency on investigations by FINRA and the SEC in response to short and distort campaigns reported by companies such as ours. We also urge the SEC to expand 13F disclosure to include short positions, as requested by the rulemakings filed by NIRI, NYSE, and Nasdaq. In Japan, the SEC allows full transparency into short selling activity. In our opinion, the U.S. should be leading the way in this regard. The lack of transparency in short selling is not consistent with int ernational norms or best practices , or with the SEC’s institutional mandate to protect the interests of shareholders. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impact s of th is 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post-pandemic-corporate -activism . 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism -in-the-post -pandemic-market -what -you-need -to-know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepar e for post -pandemic activism,” April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards -can-prepare-post -pandemic-activism .

(NYSE: GEF, GEF.B), a global leader in industrial packaging products and services headquartered in Delaware, Ohio , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to no longer be required to file , would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and our investor base. I f enacted, the proposed rule would negatively impact engagement with sharehold ers, hinder our ability to attract and retain long-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds .

Furthermore, 13F data enables our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. This potentially deprives shareholders of the time they deserve with company management. We ask that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance and Nasdaq.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 -1090 Re: File Number S7-08-20 Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, As the largest service provider of Form 13F reporting solutions in the world, ACN appreciates the chance to comment on the Proposal to increase the Form 13F reporting threshol d from $100 million to $3.5 billion. We have helped thousands of investment managers with 13F EDGAR filings and thoroughly understand the process, cost, and burden it places on firms. There are two major problems with the Proposal. First, it overstates the burden that 13F reporting places on firms. The cost of 13F compliance for the average firm is way below $21,611.16 per year. In fact, we only charge $125 per quarter for 13F filing services, for a yearly total of $500. The average firm does not need a compliance attorney to figure out if they meet the market - value -filing threshold. In its simplest form, a firm needs to know two things: (1) the total value of assets it has discretion over, and (2) the total value of discretionary assets that are on the Official List of 13F Securities. A firm inherently knows which assets are discretionary and can easily match their investments against the Official List of 13F Securities, which the Commission conveniently makes public each quarter. Nor does a firm need a senior programmer to access the necessary data for the filing. Most firms produce the required 13F information from specific modules in standard portfolio management software packages or custodian data platforms. The second problem is that the proposal undercuts market transparency. As noted in Commissioner Allison Lee’s public statement, the Proposal would eliminate access to discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers, which represent $2.3 trillion in assets. This is directly contrary to the purpose behind 13F filings, which is “to facilitate the collection and public dissemination of information concerning the holdings of and transactions in securities by institutional investment managers.” It is also foreseeable that larger firms that currently hold over $3.5 billion will change how they operate to avoid filing 13F reports. And as you know, the U.S. security markets are the most liquid in the world because of our deep market transparency and oversight. The Proposal, as written, reduces this transparency and meaningfully detracts from our competitive advantage. At the same time, the Proposal is trying to fix a problem that does not exist, since the cost on a quarterly basis is much lower than the Proposal’s estimate costs. For these reasons, it is our opinion that the SEC should not adopt the Proposal. We would be pleased to meet with the Commission’s staff to discuss our thoughts concerning the Proposal, as well as our insights regarding the cost of 13F compliance. If you have any questions on our comment letter, please feel free to contact me directly at (833) ACN -FILE (226-3453). Sincerely, /s/ Russell P. Moenich Russell P. Moenich Executive Chairman"

We do not believe that the Commission has ade quately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to confer regularly with our investors throughout the year.

We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers stop disclosing their positions , would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would 1) impair engagement with our shareholders , 2) impede our ability to attract new long- term investors, and 3) deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that may take a position in our company . The 13F filings are the only comprehensive source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers . While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts . We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year . As a $1.6 Billion market capitalization company, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 28% of our current 13F filers to stop disclos ing their position. This group i ncludes two firms that are among our top 20 institutional shareholders . While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , six of our top 20 institution s are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter . For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment 2 managers and hedge funds that fall below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable .1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activi sm but also those shareholders with smaller positions who either have a significant portion of their portfolio invested in our company or are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into th ese important group s. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have inves ted in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during the se uncertain times, when market volatility is high 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor thos e activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research and development funding, or take other measures t hat may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors.

Brett Robison,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223171.htm,,"Sep. 09, 2020 I believe it makes sense to raise the threshold for 13f reporting. The original threshold was adopted in 1975 to obtain data on bigger institutional investment managers' impact on the US equity market. Since then the market has gone from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion. Yet the threshold being observed has not changed with the market. It makes sense that raising the threshold to closely match the market changes over the past 45 years will take away the burden of reporting from smaller managers and make the data that is collected more relevant to the original intent to monitor larger institutional managers' influence on the market. this proposal seems like a win-win since it will free up more time for us to focus on our clients and their investments and less time that government spends collecting data that doesn’t pertain to the original intent One of the other changes proposed is to review the reporting threshold every five years and recommend adjustments accordingly which I do support.

(NYSE: PWR), a specialty infrastructure solutions provider headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are writing to respectfully express our opposition to the Commission's proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment manager s. As a publicly traded midcap company, we rely significantly on 13F filings to aid in our stockholder engagement efforts- as it is the primary source of accurate institutional ownership data available. While we welcome the Commission's interest in modernizing 13F reporting , we believe that the proposed amendment s would significantly reduce transparen cy around our ownership and hedge fund activism, as well as meaningfully undermine our investor engagement efforts and deprive our retail investors of information they use to make investment decisions . We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal and instead consider the reforms that were detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute {NIRI), the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance and Nasdaq.1 As set forth in those petitions, rather than allow approximately 90 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, we urge the Commission to reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions and support legislation that provides for monthly stock ownership disclosure.2 1 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficia l Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13{f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(l) of Rule 13f-1, Petition No. 4-659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/ rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rule making Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13{f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/ru les/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf.; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/ru les/petitions/2015/petn4-691. pdf. 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short positions. See 15 U.S.C. § 78m(f)(2) (""The Commission shall prescribe rules providing for the public disclosure of the name of the issuer and the title, class, CUSIP number, aggregate amount of the number of short sales of each security, and any additional information determined by the Commission following the end of the reporting period. At a minimum, such public disclosure shall occur every month.""). QUANTA SERVICES While there has been a meaningful shift in equity assets under management over the past couple decades to passive investment products, such as index funds, ETFs and quantitative strategies, which public companies rarely engage with, actively managed equity firms remain the majority and an important portion of our current and potential investor base. As a result, active engagement with them is critical, and we believe that this proposal would seriously jeopardize our shareholder engagement efforts by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers -or nearly 90% of all filers -from the required disclosure . Based on reporting data as of June 30, 2020, actively managed firms that report under 13F owned approximately 55 percent of Quanta's outstanding shares. If the proposal were enacted, we would lose visibility on more than 50 percent of these actively managed firms, resulting in a significant loss of market transparency regarding a large portion of our investor base. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and the current proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders, corporations and elected officials are increasingly calling for greater transparency. We ask the Commission to pause and reconsider the implications of this proposed rule, and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency in a manner consistent with recommendation s submitted by NIRI, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.

Nickolas Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer September 9, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM), a provider of building materials including aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and hot mixed asphalt headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, I am writing to express our opposition to the Comm ission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company, our shareholders, and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of timely informat ion about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for thei r research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation, desire and expectation that we regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. Indee d, when considering our Say On Pay and other matters voted on during our annual meeting, many investors judge our governance based on our engagement with shareholders, among other matters. As a $13 billion market capitalization company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow ~50% of our current 13F filers to avoid disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into thi s important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutiona l investors. Like many other issuers, we attempt to use 13F filings to identify potential shareholder s (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are helpful for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our busine ss. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and ot her public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic. 2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “ SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy, ” July 29, 2020 , available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed - rule-change- step-193708183.html . 2 As Cha irman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current f inancial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.” Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, ""The Importance of Disclosure – For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COV ID-19,"" April 8, 2020. data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long - term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that we take measures that may not be part of our long-t erm strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-t erm investors. 4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and public ly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. In addition, even if the SEC determines that revisions to 13F are warranted, the proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F t hreshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation- based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies, 5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""I nsight : Preparing for Post -Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020 , available at: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/corporate -governance/insight -preparing -for-post-pandemic -corporate - activism . 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Acti vism in the Post -Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020 , available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism -in-the-post-pandemic -mark et-what -you-need-to-know/ ; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary , “How boards can prepare for post -pandemic activism, ” April 6, 2020 ; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how -boards - can-prepare -post-pandemic -activism . 5 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Rele ase Nos. 33 - 10332; 34 -80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017). accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Com mission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. 8 Rather than reduce 13F t ransparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

Focusing Capital on th e Long Term began in 2013 as an initiative of the CPP Investments McKinsey & Company, which together with BlackRock, Dow , and Tata Sons founded FCLTGlobal in July 2016. In addition to our Founders, today our 5 0+ Member organizations span the investment value chain, including asset owners, asset managers and corporations, and are committed to accomplishing long - term tangible actions to lengthen the timeframe of capital allocation decisions. The SEC is inviting public comments on a proposal to update the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers (Form 13F). This amendment would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion1 in assets under management (AUM) , and according to the commission reflect “ proportionally the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million [AUM] represented in 1975, the time of the statutory directive.”2 Based on FCLTGlobal’s review of existing academic evidence, our own analysis, and research informed by our multi -year conversations with our Members and other experts, we suggest the SEC carefully consider the following points : • There are alternative ways to modernize 13F reporting • Small investors can have a n enormous impact on a company • Providing transparency to companies about their shareholders is valuable and to be encouraged 1 Source: “ SEC Proposes Amendments to Update Form 13F for Institutional Investment Managers; Amend Reporting Threshold to Reflect Today’s Equities Markets ,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, July 10, 2020, https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152 2 Source: “ SEC Proposes Amendments to Update Form 13F for Institutional Investment Ma nagers; Amend Reporting Threshold to Reflect Today’s Equities Markets ,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, July 10, 2020, https://www.sec.gov/news/press -release/2020 -152 RIN: 3235 -AM65 Modernizing 13F While FCLTGlobal appreciates the issue of modernizing regulation, there are alternative ways to achieve this goal . Notably , the current 45-day reporting period for form 13F was based on a paper and mail world ; such reporting delay is no longer needed in our electronically advanced capital markets . In today’s world of electronic trading and T+1 settlement , investors know their positions near - instantaneously . The idea of a long reporting lag to allow time to compile the required information is outdated. Furthermore, this 45 -day period is in practice a 135-day period if we account for the 90 -day- long quarter . Thus, we urge the Commission to consider shortening this period to better reflect the current investment environment. Small investors as important actors FCLTGl obal has recently completed research on the role of long -term institutional investors in activism : Making the Call: The Role of Long -term Institutional Investors in Activism 3. Our findings indicate that activists only hold 0.3%4 of assets under management worldwide but have an enormous impact on companies . Although activists ’ holdings are relatively small , they are an important and growing influence on companies’ short -or long -term behavior. By increasing the AUM reporting thresh old to $3.5 billion , a company’s ability to identify a small, but potentially impactful investor, such as an activist , will be greatly diminished . We suggest the Commission consider modifying the threshold based on the Consumer Price Index, which would modernize the threshold to reflect today’s market value while still allowing companies to identify smaller investors. Engagement and transparency Constructive dialogue between smaller holders and companies is to be encouraged. Our work on long - term roadmaps5 shows that the investor/corporate dialogue is critical for long -term value creation . Encouraging engagement for small and large investors alike can level the playing field for small er investors. We also found that trans parency , specificall y knowing one’s shareholders , is necessary to begin a dialogue and understand the various shareholder perspectives. In our 2019 whitep aper Predicting Long - Term Success for Corporations and Investors Worldwide6 we establish the importance of long -term shareholders , who demonstratively contribute to long -term value creation for their portfolio companies. The ability to identify and engage with these long -term shareholders , irrespective of size, would be jeopardized by decreased t ransparency . Furthermore , we also suggest the commission to consider expanding its disclosure requirements to include short positions . 3 Mirchandani, B., Tellez, V., “Making the Call: The Role of Long -term Institutional Investors in Activism”, July 2020, https://www.fcltglobal.org/resource/activism/ 4 Mirchandani, B., Tellez, V ., “Making the Call: The Role of Long -term Institutional Investors in Activism”, July 2020, https://www.fcltglobal.org/resource/activism/ 5 Babcock, He, Tellez, “ Driving the Conversation: Long -Term Roadmaps for Long -Term Success ,” February 2019, https://www.fcltglobal.org/resource/driving -the-conversation -long -term -roadmaps -for-long -term -success/ 6 Mirchandani, et al, “ Predicting Long -Term Success for Corporations and Investors Worldwide ,” September 2019, https://www.fcltglobal.org/resource/predicting -long -term -success -for-corporations -and-investors -worldwide/ RIN: 3235 -AM65 Conclusio n FCLTGlobal is pleased with the Commission’s desire to modernize the current reporting of 13F forms to better reflect today’s world . However, raising the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion risks diminishing compan ies’ ability to constructively engage with small shareholders. Our research indicates that small shareholders can have a significant impact, and that knowing one’s shareholders is a necessary step in the investor/corporate dialogue . We appreciate the opportunity to submit these remarks for consideration . Should anyone at the SEC have questions about the research or our remarks, we would welcome the prospect of further discussion.

Elizabeth Wong,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7753721-223172.htm,,"September 9, 2020 I would like to be clear that I am opposed to this suggested regulatory change. The 13f filings rule as it stands is an incredible tool to the little investor like me, who uses the information to subsidize the important need for stock research, by being able to leverage what professional portfolios are doing and what companies they are doing it with in a timely manner. I do not have, nor can I afford a team of analysts to help create or confirm my research in a company. But being able to follow along with professional portfolio managers and see their decisions on what stocks they are buying and selling based on their teams of analysts' research, is an immense boost of confidence to a small investor to see that several professionals bought a stock that her or she is interested in. I hope the SEC considers the importance of this information and that it remain publicly available for the missions of small investors who are becoming more financially literate because of the availability of managers like Guy Spier and Mohnesh Pabrai. Both of whom would be excused from filing by this change. We rely on these small institutional investors' activity for affirmation of our own research as well as an excellent and steady source of already well researched new ideas. As an indication of the importance and demand for these filings' information, entire websites have been created that are dedicated to these 13f filings like Gurufocus.com, Dataroma.com and WhaleWisdom.com (and at least a dozen more) Gurufocus.com alone has over 500,000 unique visitors a month seeking this information. These are not just sites consolidating the information contained within the 13f filings, they are employers of hundreds of people. These sites all would become incredibly less effective by this change (Gurufocus alone includes over six thousand portfolio managers who currently file that would no longer be required to under the new regulations) and thus many of them will shutter, creating a loss of employment to many who rely on the public demand for this information as the source of their employment. Additionally, the cost of providing this information will have to be shared across a much smaller user base if all the information we could get was on portfolios of $3.5B and above, thus significantly increasing the fees of these sites to the smaller investors trying to follow the professional money managers. We will end up paying more for considerably less information all the while losing the most pertinent information to us, the money managers who manage portfolios between $100M and $3.5B. In the 1970's, when this regulation was put into effect, the purpose was to disclose portfolios that could move the market to the benefit of other large investors. Today, things have changed. The small investor is looking for more disclosure, not less. Now, this data is used by millions of small investors like me to improve our investing results by using it to confirm our researchand provide new ideas of additional investments we may not have found on our own. We hope you will focus less on what the intent of this regulation was 50 years ago and focus more on how this information is effectively used by the modern-day investing community. Please support the small investor and prioritize the current value of keeping this regulatory requirement in place, just as it has been for almost 50 years. It is more valuable now than ever before. Thank you for your consideration.Elizabeth Wong"

We believe that the SEC's proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dai·k, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-te1m investors and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take investment positions in our stock. The l 3F filings ai·e the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers.

This info1mation cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance films, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a staiiing point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a ~$5.5 billion mid cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3 .5 billion would allow~ 7% of our shares owned by actively managed funds to avoid disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.' Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to help allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot say yes to eve1y investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this imp01tant group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach eff01is to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quaiter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicable"" to investors amid the market unce1tainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transpai·ency on our pait to our investors, our need 1 According to Edel.man's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold .

Disclosure -providing the public with the information necessa1y to make informed inveshnent decisions -is fundamental to fmihering each aspect of our mission .... We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning."" Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, 2 for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3 .5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus ""gaming the system"" and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company's long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be pait of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC's proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-te1m investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3 .5 billion threshold is planning a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent ( or often more) position. Some years ago, Oshkosh was engaged in an activist fight and we prevailed, although our victmy over the activist was expensive and detracted from our mission. Ultimately, our strategy and commitment to shareholder value helped our company and shareholders succeed while saving thousands of jobs in small towns across the United States. Less shareholder transparency would have made it more difficult for our company and shareholders to be successful. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-te1m investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh Division of Corporation Finance, ""The Importance of Disclosure -For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID-19,"" April 8, 2020. 3 See Lisa Silverman, Bloomberg Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post-Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, available at: https://news.bloomberglaw .com/corporate-governance/insight-preparing-for-post-pandemic-corporate­ activism. 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post-Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://q4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism-in-the-post-pandemic-market-what-you-need-to-know/; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretmy, ""How boards can prepare for post-pandemic activism,"" April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how-boards­ can-prepare-post-pandemic-activism . 3 the modest cost savings for investment managers.

Further, lam a member of the National Investor Relations Institute (""NIRI""). The Commission's proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of$ 100 million, would allow 89 percent of current l 3F filers to go dark. This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our shareholders along with other public companies such as ours in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long-term investors , and deprive AZZ of timely information about activist fund managers that may choose to take positions in our company. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on companies like AZZ and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to AZZ as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that AZZ has that shows which investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly l 3F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Myself, along with other members ofNIRl work for (or advise) small-and mid-cap companies , which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. Smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemakin g. AZZ agrees with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduce transparency and the public's access to market informati on.

Lauren Dalton,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223174.htm,,"Sep. 08, 2020 To Whom it May Concern: I am writing in favor of the proposed rule to update the reporting threshold, effectively raising the amount needed to file. The original threshold was adopted in 1975 to obtain data on bigger institutional investment managers' impact on the US equity market. Since then the market has gone from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion. Yet the threshold being observed has not changed with the market. It makes sense that raising the threshold to closely match the market changes over the past 45 years will take away the burden of reporting from smaller managers such as ourselves and make the data that is collected more relevant to the original intent to monitor the larger institutional managers' influence on the market. Smaller firms, and those who would prefer to manage a smaller number of clients, can focus on fiduciary duties on existing clients while their clients' portfolios have grown with the market in essentially a ""passive"" manner due to how rapid the growth of the equity market has been. Additional regulatory reporting weighs heavily on smaller firms, and especially for the actual market share they represent, this threshold is outdated. I am in favor of revisting the intent of the original threashold, as it was to regulate those with a larger overall market share - Larger firms, and those intending to become large firms with the personnell capable of handling an additional regulatory burden, without harm to the client experience.

(NYSE: SMP), an automotive replacement parts manufacturer and distributor headquartered in Long Island City , NY, we are writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public ly traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would significantly impair engagement with our shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long- term investors, deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock, and exacerbate short -term pressures on our company at the expense of long -term shareholder value . The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buyi ng or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has ade quately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to confer regularly with our investors throughout the year. As a $1 billion market capitalization company, we are particularly concerned about two areas. First, how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them , and measure the effectiveness of our 37-18 Northern Blvd., Long Island City, NY 11101 718.392.0200 | www.smpcorp.com 2 shareholder outreach . Second, our ability to monitor activist investors would be greatly reduced and put the company at risk of sacrificing long -term value for short -term activist measures. Reduced Shareholder Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activi sm, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this impor tant group. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “ provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid t he market uncertainty caused by the global C OVID -19 pandemic. 1 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting the ir positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. 2 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare 1 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty.

"Erin S. Edwards, Ph.D.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7753742-223196.htm,,"September 8, 2020 I am opposed to this regulation change.The 13f filings rule as it stands is an important source of information to the average investor who is trying to learn how to responsibly invest in stocks. The professionals who currently are required to file 13f filings have access to more elite business people, business meetings, more education, and other experienced professionals than the average investor. The 13f filing requirement helps to narrow the gap between the average person and investors who have attended expensive, elite business schools. These pros, who already have access to lots of capital, not only had access to a costly education but also were able to build up networks to gain more information. The 13f filings help broaden this information to more than an elite few. Being able to see what percentage a pro bought a stock, in a price range, gives the average person access to information that would come up in professional conversations in elite circles that have restricted access just by virtue of who you know.If you care about the wealth divide getting larger, please do not remove one of rules that helps to make access to information more equitable, information about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing.Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the pro investors I follow, such as Guy Spier and Mohnesh Pabrai, both of whom will be excused from filing by this change. Because I do not have access to a highly successful investor to learn about the stock market, I rely on small institutional investors for the best sort of guidance in the stock market.

Wendy Wilson,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7741253-223136.pdf,,"1 September 7, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34- 89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Orion Engineered Carbons (NYSE: OEC), a chemical corporation with principal executive offices in Kingwood, Texas, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. 2 We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a $3B+ marketcap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 90% of our current 13F filers to evade disclosure. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-proposed- rule-change-step-193708183.html . 3 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three-part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty.

The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.8 Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

We represent members who are investor relations officers at 40 publicly held companies headquartered in th e Dallas*Fort Worth, Texas, area. These companies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and N asdaq , have a combine d market capitalization of approximately $609 billion . We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million , would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark . This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our member s’ compan ies as well as other publi c companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede companies’ ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive our members of timely information about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies . We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our member s’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throug hout the year. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our member s’ compan ies as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that s hows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small - and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fa ll under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting , so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. We a lso agree with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee , who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduc e transparency and the public’s access to market information . She also question ed whether the SEC “has the authority to purs ue” those changes by pointing out that the “enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold. ”1 2 While o ur member s agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on their ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long -term investors, and monitor activists far outweigh any potential cost savings for investment managers. In addition, the proposed 35 -fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules . For the above reasons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.3 1 As Commissioner Lee point ed out in her dissenting statement : “To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter (emphasis added) . The text is clear: Congress set a statuto ry reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it.

Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 directed the Commission to require 13F filers to report short positions each month, while Section 951 of Dodd - Frank instructed the SEC to require 13F filers to annually disclose their votes on executive compensation matters. 3 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Repor ting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659 (February 4, 2013 ), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689 (October 7, 2015 ), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petitio n Rather than reduce transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by working with Congress to support monthly reporting, requir e the public disclosure of short positions, and reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period . To achieve these objectives , we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors , issuers , and the exchanges on a wide range of market transparency issues, incl uding potential 13F reforms, propos ed rules to address “short and distort” abuses, and the modernization of 13D reporting.4 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation.

As a $3B market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage ef fectively with them.

As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts – as they are the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around these holdings and the reby significantly impact issuer -investor engagement , particularly for small and mid -cap companies such as ours. With respect to our company specifically, based on reporting data as of June 30, 2020, there were 243 institution s holding 23.9 million shares of Masonite (NYSE:DOOR) , or 97.4% of the total shares outstanding. If the proposal were to be enacted as written , we would lose visibility to approximately 74 , or 30%, of our shareholders that are 13F filers, a significant loss of market transparency. Further, under this proposal we would lose visibility to our second largest shareholder , activist investor Praesidium . We also believe that this proposal would jeopardize our shareholder engagement efforts with the broader investor community, by excluding more than 5,000 investment managers – or nearly 90% of all filers – from disclosure. The long -term impact of this proposal could be detrimental to the public equity markets in the U.S. more generally , as it may deter private companies from going public, or prompt them to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency with respect to reporting disclosures. We therefore respectfully request that the Commission further consider th e implications of this proposed rule and refocus its efforts on modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve , rather than reduce, institutional share holder transparency. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clear , particularly during periods of economic uncertainty as we now face , and we believe this proposal would be counterproductive at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Sincerely, Russ ell T. Tiejema Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Masonite Internat ional Corpor ation"

UNFI, a publicly traded company with a market cap of approximately $1 billion, relies on quarterly 13F filings to understand UNFI’s shareholder base and changes to that base over time, which inform both our engagement activities with current holders and outreach efforts to attract new holders. Of note, our largest actively managed shareholder would not be required to file under this proposal, nor would 20% of our top 25 holders. We are unique in our capital structure, with our market cap of $1B being very low compared to our total enterprise value and to our annual revenues of approximately $23B. We believe that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other publicly traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, weaken our ability to attract new investors, adversely impact prudent corporate governance, and deprive us of timely information about potential activism. UNFI is a large, complex public company that relies on timely information from 13F filings to manage our investor base effectively. Increasing the filing threshold will create a complete dearth of information in attempting to navigate changes in our shareholder base – a key to maintaining and growing shareholder value --that will place UNFI at a competitive disadvantage to our broader public company industry peers, such as large retail grocery firms, with larger market caps (and larger investors) who would continue to have complete information. Ultimately, UNFI is driven in our objective to increase shareholder value, and we believe increasing the threshold will be a significant hurdle to our ability to continue to do so effectively. In the spirit of providing full commentary, we suggest the Commission consider 1) shortening the reporting timeframes to no more than 30 days, 2) make it applicable to both short and long positions, and 3) make filing requirements monthly rather than quarterly. We expect that this would place little, if any, burden on investment firms. Under the current proposal, the investment world would have less transparency (not more). The only winners, if you want to think of it that way, would likely be hedge funds and activists while issuers such as UNFI would clearly have lost important insights into its shareholder base. I frankly don’t think that is a result anyone would like to see. Sincerely, Bob Houghton Senior Vice President - Finance United Natural Foods, Inc."

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D .C. 20549 Re: Amending the Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers , Release No. 34 -89290; File No. S7 -08-20 (July 10 , 2020) Dear Ms. Countryman : The Private Investor Coalition (“ PIC”) submits these comments in response to Release No. 3 4- 89290 (the “ Proposing Release ”) in which the S ecurities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) proposed certain amendments to 17 CFR 240.13f -1 (“Rule 13f -1”) and Form 13F (referenced in 17 CFR 249.325) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (“ Exchange Act”). PIC is a nationwide organization consisting of single family offices (“SFOs ”) who share a common interest in public policy issues impacting the SFO community. PIC describes itself as the recognized authority on legislative and regulatory issues affe cting SFOs and as the primary resource for disseminating information on legislative, regulatory and compliance issues impacting SFOs. PIC supports the SEC’s goal to raise the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports from $100 million to $3.5 billion . The increased threshold effectively balances the benefits of transparency in the public markets and the costs of regulatory compliance for smaller investment managers. If enacted, the proposed rule would reduce the compliance burden on smaller investment manag ers, including many SFOs, while maintaining the benefits of transparency provided to the public markets by including over 90% of the market value of equity securities held by currently reporting institutional managers. Responses to Specific Requests for Co mment The Proposing Release asked several questions concerning the proposed Rule 13f -1 amendments. PIC provides the following responses to those questions. The question numbers are those set forth in the Proposing Release. 2 8. Are Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? SFOs are exempt from registration with the SEC as investment advisers pursuant to Rule 202(a)(11)(g) -1 (the “ Family Office Rule ”) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act ”). In adopting the Family Office Rule, the SEC recognized the benefit of reducing compliance costs for S FOs (Release No. IA -3220). Relief from the costs of compliance with Rule 13f -1 for smaller SFOs ( i.e., those with less than $3.5 billion in assets under management) is especially welcome. SFOs bear both the internal costs of preparing and reviewing a Form 13F, which includes staff time and resources, and external costs of legal and compliance advisers. In addition to the costs of the Form 13F, many SFOs must also prepare a Confidential Treatment Request (“ CTR ”) application under 17 CFR 240.24b -2(c), the ass ociated expense of engaging an attorney or other service to file a paper copy of the Form 13F CTR with the SEC in Washington, D.C. each quarter. Pursuant to Section 13(f)(4) of the Exchange Act, any information identifying the securities held by the accou nt of a natural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or investment company) shall not be disclosed to the public (the “ Personal Holdings Exemption ”). The Personal Holdings Exemption provides a basis for granting confidential treatment where Form 13F would reveal the identity of a natural person or a trust. Since SFOs, by definition, advise only natural persons, including their family -owned private investment vehicles, trusts, and charitable foundations, many SFOs filing a Form 13F rely on the Personal Holdings Exemption. The first CTR is particularly time consuming and can be costly . The initial application is often subject to review and comment by the SEC, and may involve multiple rounds and revisions to the application. Finally, many SFOs are required to file both a confidential Form 13F and a public Form 13F. The SEC has required that, to the extent securities held by SFOs are reported publicly under Section 13 (d) or Section 16 of the Exchange Act, such securities must be reported on a public Form 13F. In addition, the SEC requires that securities held by “key employees” of an SFO (as defined in the Family Office Rule) who are not family members also be reported on the public Form 13F. This results in a unique burden for SFOs – a dua l filing requirement necessitating two Forms 13F each quarter, one that is filed publicly on EDGAR and one paper copy accompanied by a CTR that is filed with the SEC by hand. 12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in conn ection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? How do the costs differ for larger and smaller managers? How much internal time do managers devote to compl iance with Form 13F? What are the external costs, such as the costs of a third - party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? We request comment on the direct compliance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13 F, including estimate in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers. We estimate that the annual costs of compliance for a typical SFO filing quarterly Form s 13F is $20,000 - $40,000. This estimate includes SFO staff time and resources and outside advisers for 3 both the public Form 13 F and the CTR. Costs are higher in the initial year of filing since preparation of the first CTR is more time consuming and often entails a period of review by the SEC with responses by the SFO to address any qu estions or issues that arise during the review. Costs will also vary depending on whether the SFO is required to prepare dual Forms 13F, and whether the SFO engages outside attorneys or consultants or handles the filings internally. 13. We also request com ment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect cost, such as the potential for front - running and copycatting. In addition to the direct compliance costs borne by SFOs, Rule 13f indirectly harms SFOs as investors by negatively affecting the performance of the investment advisers SFOs engage to manage their assets. When the performance of these advisers suffers due to copycatting or frontrunning, the beneficial owners of the funds and accounts ultimately bear those losses. However, the cost in diminished performance is only part of the harm done to SFOs. SFOs invest significant resources in order to source and dilig ence investment opportunities, including research on external investment advisers. The value of this research is reduced when the performance of the advisers is compromised by disclosure of their trading activity. In addition to copycatting and frontrunni ng, a meaningful indirect cost that has more potential to harm small managers is the possibility of reverse engineering t rading strategies. Forms 13F divulge more information about the trading strategies of small managers than large managers because large managers more often manage multiple portfolios with different strategies whose positions are combined into the same disclosure. This makes it more difficult to reverse engineer the strategy (or strategies) of a large manager than a smaller one because of the inherent challenges in finding patterns in all of the additional data . In other words, t he fewer positions disclosed on a Form 13F, the more vulnerable the reporting manager is to detrimental copycatting of not only particular trades, but entire stra tegies . Finally, it should be noted that SFOs not only frequently engage managers whose performance may suffer indirectly from public disclosure of their positions, but SFOs often manage complicated portfolios themselves, either instead of hiring external managers, or in addition to their external managers. SFOs therefore are affected both as investors and as managers. PIC would support automatic periodic adjustment of the proposed threshold to reflect appropriate changes in market conditions . We believe th at market growth is an appropriate measure for adjusting the reporting threshold since it keeps the relative size of the reporting managers and the overall market stable. If over time, however, this was detrimental to market transparency (for example if, i n the future, smaller managers make up a significantly larger portion of the market), this measure could be revisited. In addition to the increased threshold, PIC would support the creation of a streamlined process for Form 13 CTR for investment managers, including SFOs, whose assets under management exceed the new threshold. Rather than filing a Form 13F CTR each quarter, PIC recommends that the SEC adopt a process whereby an investment manager seeking confidential treatment of its Form 13F filing only be required to file a Form 13F CTR one time. Once confidential treatment has been granted, the investment manager would then be required only to reaffirm the 4 representations made in the initial Form 13F CTR to be accorded confidential treatment for future fi lings. If, at any time the investment manager could no longer reaffirm all of the representations made in the initial Form 13F CTR, it would either lose confidential treatment or be required to file a new Form 13F CTR in order to maintain such treatment. Moreover, PIC believes that CTR submissions can and should be accomplished electronically, either through a secure portal under EDGAR or another platform or by email. Requiring paper submissions is antiquated, more expensive and unnecessary and should be eliminated. Finally , PIC would strongly advocate for elimination of the requirement for dual filings where an SFO is a Section 13 (d) or Section 16 filer, or where key employees who are not family members hold securities that are also held by the famil y investment vehicles. This puts an exceptional burden on SFOs without providing any new information to the SEC or adding to market transparency since all of the information on the public Form 13F filing is already available to both the SEC and public on t he applicable Schedule 13d (or 13g) or Form 4. * * * PIC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Release and would be pleased to answer any questions that the SEC or its staff might have concerning its comments.

Based on my experience at small- and mega -cap publicly traded companies in industries ranging from consumer brands to industrial materials , I believe these proposed amendments, if enacted, would be detrimental to public companies and the effective ness of the public capital markets . The proposed amendments would raise the asset reporting threshold for institutional investors to $3.5 billion from the current $100 million threshold. This change would result in more than 4,500 institutions – nearly 89% of total current filers – becoming exempt from filing 13F report s detailing their stock positions . 13F filings are the only accurate source of investor ownership data for publicly traded companies . Accordingly , reducing the number of filers would significantly limit a public compan y’s ability to know and understand its investor base . Knowing and understanding who owns what is key to helping companies align management and shareholder interests. Such knowledge helps public companies allocate management time among significant and influential investors and promote s mutual understanding of company/i nvestor interests and objectives . Knowing who owns what also helps companies identify and attract potential new investors , which assists in the capital raising process . Conversely , not knowing their investor base leaves companies vulnerable to being blindsided by activist investor campaigns and potentially pressured to pursue strategies not in the best long -term interests of the company and its other stakeholders. Additionally , under the proposed rule changes , only institutional investors with greater than $3.5 billion of assets under management will continue to file 13F reports . The vast majority of these institutions are passive investors , mean ing their invest ing strategy is designed to track an index (however that index may be defined) . In effect, these institutions own a market -capitalization weighted interest in the companies comprising that index and rebalance their portfolio on auto -pilot . Page 2 There is no picking or choosing of i ndividual stocks based on company strategy or business fundamentals . A consequence of this is it facilitates the big getting bigger as investment ca pital flow s to the larger companies that belong to an index. Indeed, since 1997, we’ve seen the average market capitalization of public companies increase, while the number of public small- cap companies has dropped dramatically1. Small- cap companies as well as young, high -growth potential companies s eeing this concentration of ownership in index -member companies and w ithout knowledge of the broad spectrum of institutional investors derived from robust 13F reporting may conclu de that the public markets are not a place for them. Instead, the y may increasingly look to private equity for capital, which puts the vibrancy of the public markets at risk . Finally, in a world where massive amounts of data are collected, stored and analyze d, where stocks are traded in microseconds and communications are near- instantaneous , the rationale for raising the 13F reporting threshold appears , at best, disconnected from reality. Especially when compared with the extensive level of disc losure required by public companies , 13F reporting by institutional investors in no way appears onerous . If anything, it would seem appropriate to accelerate the deadline for 13F reporting to something less than the current 45 days after quarter end. To wrap up , I would like to recall the SEC’s conclusion from its report to Congress in the early 1970s : “The past and likely future growth of institutional investors in the equity markets, makes the collection of timely information about institutional holdings and activity in securities essential for an agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws . . .The importance of a regularized, uniform, and comprehensive scheme of institutional reporting cannot be minimized in light of the demonstrated growth of institutional investment and its impact on the structure of the securities markets, corporate issuers and individual investors.2” This con clusion was quite prescient . It remains relevant today and is consistent with the spirit and intent of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act: to foster free and fair markets for all constituents . The Commission’s proposed amendments to Form 13F reporting rules are, in my view, contrary to this and should not be adopted.

S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to propose amendments to its Form 13F disclosure rules, which would dramatically reduce the number of investment managers and hedge funds required to report their holdings quarterly. Under the proposal, the minimum threshold for 13F disclosure would increase by 35 times from $100 million in U.S. equities under management to $3.5 billion. An analysis by the New York Stock Exchange concludes that this rule change would have a serious impact on transparency that would disproportionately impact public companies with market capitalizations under $250 million, the level the SEC refers to as ""smaller public companies"". Sequans is one such public company with a current market cap of around $190 million. Since our IPO in April 2011, we have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and have relied on 13F filing data as our only reliable source of ownership information to inform our board of directors, guide our shareholder outreach program, help us set appropriate priorities in allocating management's time in response to requests for meetings, and to help us follow up on voting to assure a quorum at our Annual General Meeting. An analysis of our current 13-F data indicates that, under the proposed rule change, 6 of our 10 largest institutional 13F filers, representing 62% of our total institutional ownership, would no longer be required to make these quarterly filings. Furthermore, 9 of our 15 largest institutional 13F positions, representing 29.9% of our total outstanding ADSs, would no longer be required to file. Under the current rule, we struggle to maintain an accurate picture of our institutional ownership because family offices and funds with equity assets below the current threshold represent a significant portion of our institutional ownership. The proposed rule change would severely limit our visibility to a group of large institutions that would be apt to include mainly brokerage firms and index or other passively-managed funds, the least relevant filers in terms of maintaining a strong ongoing dialogue with the company's institutional investor base. For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement common-sense reforms designed to increase market transparency, such as those detailed in rule-making petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE, the Society for Corporate Governance and Nasdaq.

While we support the Commission’s efforts to modernize 13F reporting and reduce the burden on smaller institutional managers, we are writing to express our concerns about the repercussions of this proposal and respectfully request that the Commission considering lowering the proposed filing threshold for institutional investment managers. Specifically, our concerns are as follows: 1) We believe that the implementation of this proposal to raise the threshold for filing the form 13F to $3.5 billion from $100 million will ultimately provide less transparency to corporate issuers such as Curtiss-Wright. Institutional managers that would no longer be subject to the current rules would include 175 holders or nearly 12% of Curtiss-Wright’s shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020. 2) We believe the information provided in the Commission’s proposal will provide much less visibility into potential actions being taken by activist investors, most of which would now be protected from filing their institutional holdings. 3) We believe that having less reporting data available on our shareholders’ equity positions will be detrimental to our communication efforts (potential for reduced investor engagement driven by fewer form 13F filings available) and our ability to track quarterly shareholder activity. Today, 13F filings are the only accurate means of tracking institutional holdings. As the Commission states within the proposal, “We recognize that raising the Form 13F reporting threshold would decrease holdings data available to the Commission and other regulators as well as corporate issuers, market participants, and other analysts and researchers pursuant to section 13(f).” We ask you to please consider the concerns of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, along with other corporate issuers, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), and others voicing similar concerns about the detrimental effects of raising the threshold to the proposed $3.5 billion level. Further, we ask that the Commission consider the suggestions previously set forth by corporate issuers and the aforementioned organizations to leverage technological advancements to 1) reduce the 45-day delay in making these quarterly 13F filings, 2) require 13F filers to disclose short positions, and 3) support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure, in an effort to modernize 13F reporting.

Our clients are able to access our holdings by simply asking us for lists of securities we have purchased or sold, at any time.

We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enact ed, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buyi ng or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has ade quately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a mid -cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow approximately 15 of our current top 100 investors to evade disclosure, in cluding two current investors who have positions representing more than 1% of p. 2 of 4 total shares outstanding each. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Tran sparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this propose d increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other is suers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and r aise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3 .5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “ SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed -rule-change -step -193708183.html . p. 3 of 4 practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the glob al COVID -19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantag e of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term -oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of our long -term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insi ght, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors.4 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activ ist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three -part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, a nd protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission. . ..

The proposed 35 -fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based incr ease in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolu tions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.8 Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45 -day reporting period.

Mark Simms,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223058.htm,,"Sep. 02, 2020 Dear Ms Countryman I hope you are well in these unprecedented times. We have been following closely the public discussion around the proposed reporting threshold change to 13F filings, which appears to consist primarily of commentary denouncing the changes in terms of a potential negative impact on transparency. In our view, the SEC’s proposed change to the reporting threshold for 13F filings need not have the negative impact on transparency that critics of the proposal are claiming. The commentary is failing to paint a true picture of market impact. In fact, they appear instead to promote opinions that focus primarily on the impact to their business models. It is our opinion that the 13F filing mechanism itself is the real issue and that such commentary fails to address two fundamental deficiencies in the 13F. 13F filings fail to provide issuers with any real transparency into their shareholders 13F filings fail to protect investors’ intellectual property and investment strategies The 13F mechanism of disclosure fails on other counts as well. Filings at best represent only c50% of investment vehicles – they rarely include Pension Funds, Hedge Funds, Activist Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Wealth Managers, etc. Filings are not representative of funds’ true positions as they are susceptible to “Window Dressing” and “Portfolio Washing” Filings’ timeliness validity is questionable as they are delayed to the last possible time allowable Therefore the SEC’s proposed change is actually not the threat to transparency that it is perceived to be, and rather, the attention should be on whether the 13F method of disclosure is actually fit for purpose in the first place. There are far better mechanisms than the 13F to achieve the two objectives above - and they have been present in capital markets worldwide for over 30 years, but not the US. In fact, the US has become an “outlier” in terms of market transparency. Not only has the reliance on 13F ensured issuers have no real transparency into their shareholders, and that investors’ investment strategies are not protected, it has also put the US in a weaker position to protect its issuers against the threat of foreign control and market abuse. As such, regulatory regimes worldwide have instead provided issuers with a far more effective solution – a Disclosure Law giving the issuer a legal right to know who has a beneficial interest in their stock. Disclosure Laws are either introduced into a country’s Companies Act, or an individual issuer’s By-Laws. These laws are rooted in an issuer’s ability to impose “disenfranchisement penalties” (typically a withdrawal of Voting Rights and Dividend Allocation) on institutional investors that fail to disclose their positions within 3 “working days”. These disclosures are not made public, to protect the investor. Examples of Countries with Disclosure Laws in their Companies Act The United Kingdom Germany Hong Kong Ireland Singapore France Norway Australia South Africa Finland Companies with A Disclosure Law Randgold Resources – (South Africa) P&O Bank of Ireland Vimpelcom – (Dutch/Russian) Electric Geodesics (US) Phrophotonix (US) Verseon (US) Halo Source (US) With such laws present, issuers can identify in-excess of 90% of their shareholders, without exposing any investor’s investment strategy. That is currently impossible for US issuers. As such, the ideal solution for the SEC to achieve its objectives of shareholder transparency for issuers and IP protection for investors, is to supplement the 13F with a US Disclosure Law. The filing threshold is almost immaterial. CMi2i has written a paper that sheds more light on this issue and the solution, which can be found attached. We hope you find it useful.

(“NOVAGOLD,” “we” or the “Company”) strongly oppose s this proposed amendment to increase the reporting threshold of 13F investor filers and we agree with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting” dated July 10, 2020 authored by Commissioner Allison Heren Lee that this proposal will drastically reduce the number of 13F filers , will reduc e public access to market information , and will constrain financial transparency . The SEC’s mission statement is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly , and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation , and this proposal runs counter to those aims. Under this new proposal, the 5,293 institutions who filed 13Fs in the first quarter of 2020 would decrease to 549 and would severely limit the ability for public companies to regularly engage with and know their shareholder base, which could damage relatio nships across the invest ment community . There is no reason why a n investment fund with $1 billion in assets under management cannot comply with existing regulations to report their holdings every quarter , or even every month . I am writing to express opposition on behalf of NOVAGOLD to the SEC’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. NOVAGOLD trade s on the NYSE American Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange, under the symbol NG , with a current market cap of $ 3.1 billion . We are a mining exploration c ompany pursuing the development of one of the largest and highest grade undeveloped known open pit gold endowments in the world, the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, which we own 50/50 with our partner Barrick Gold , the second -largest gold producer globally and also a listed issuer on those two stock exchanges . We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would res ult in a significant loss of market transparency to our Company and other public ly traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders , impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of 2  www.novagold.com NYSE American , TSX: NG timely information about activist hedge funds and other activist investors .

While 13F data is not reported as frequently as it should be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. For companies of our size, stock surveillance services are cost prohibitive. We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our Company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year . As a small- to-mid cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 117 or 40.6 % of our current 13F filers to avoid disclosure. This includes four significant current top share holders such as Paulson & Co. Inc. (currently NOVAGOLD’s third- largest shareholder); EXOR Investments (UK) LLP (currently our eighth -largest shareholder); Sprott Asset Management LP ( our ninth- largest shareholder); and Kopernik Global Investors, LLC (one o f our top 20 shareholders ). While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held , many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our Company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds that fall below the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is mo st valuable , especially for gold specific investors . 1 Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency NOVAGOLD uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives and directors among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings.

As a special sit uations ’ investment, our Company appeals to a broad array of funds that would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into the activity of th ese important group s of investors . Should this proposed rule come into effect, another challenge the C ompany would encounter is effectively allocating man agement’s time based on shareholder positions.

Ryan Prince,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-223014.htm,,"Sep. 01, 2020 To whom it may concern: I write today to express my disappointment with the Security Exchange Commission's proposed rule-making with respect to the reporting threshold for Form 13F (File Number S7-08-20). I am adamantly opposed to such a dramatic change in the filing threshold, which would substantially reduce public access to US listed company shareholdings without any material offsetting benefit for the investment management industry. The increased threshold would cast a long, dark shadow over the vast majority of active fund managers' shareholdings and in turn, a dark cloud over the shareholder register of publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges. Indeed, the proposed increase in threshold would relieve the vast majority of institutional investors from reporting requirements and thereby substantially reduce market information pertaining to company ownership and institutional investor positioning. Neither outcome has positive implications for market transparency and information efficiency. In fact, the proposed threshold increase would substantially diminish Market transparency. By establishing a thresholding considerably above the median size of active fund managers, the $3.5 billion threshold would result in filings from only the largest investment management firms, many of which have achieved scale primarily through a focus on passive, index tracking whether formally or de facto. In either case, such disclosure offers very little informational value as such investors are passive in nature and hardly the type of shareholder / owner willing to engage management directly or in many cases, even participate actively in proxy matters, including board appointments. In reading the proposed rule-making, the SEC justifies its proposal in terms of reduced compliance costs for small managers. On page 18, the SEC notes approvingly as supporting evidence average compliance costs between $15,000 and $30,000 per annum. Such cost would amount to 1 basis point of fee income for an asset manager with $225 million in assets under management. Even in light of substantial fee compression in the investment management industry, 1 basis point cost against a minimum 50 basis point active management is dinimus and hardly a burden in need of redress. In short, I urge the SEC to reconsider this regulatory change; it would mark a radical reduction in market information and transparency without clear benefit. If the intent is to reduce regulatory burden, perhaps an alternative proposal might include temporary forbearance for new investment firms for a period of time and/or a more modest increase to a threshold of $250 million. The alternative proposal would reduce initial compliance costs and provide a modest incentive for fund formation, while ensuring public access to portfolio holdings of active investors with the capacity to secure material shareholdings and exert influence either explicitly or implicitly on US public companies. A targeted policy reform may be warranted, wholesale abandonment of public shareholding disclosure by the vast majority of active managers certainly is not. Sincerely yours, Ryan J.

On behalf of the NIRI Virtual Chapter, I am writing to express our deep concern about, and strong opposition to , the proposed amend ment of Form 13F to raise the reporting threshold for ins titutional investment manager s to $3.5 billion. We strongly encourage the modernization of reporting practices and modernizing 13F reporting but believe that this proposal significantly detracts from that effort and is a step backward from the intent to understanding the impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets . In fact, the proposal continues a trend of increasing opacity regarding trading, in vesting and ownership by further limiting the public ’s access to information regarding our capital markets. The Value of Information Reported on Form 13F for Capital Market Efficiency For us in the investor relations profession, the Form 13F provides an important and practical means to understand who holds a company’s stock and how that ownership profile reflects the issuer’s strategy and outlook. More importantly, it tells us whether our communications are effectively attracting the investors that we be lieve should own our stock and informs us as to who to target for ownership. The sheer number of investors (~4,500) and the $2.3 trillion in investment value that would be shielded by this change in threshold points to the degree of opacity this creates. The impact of the threshold change is more significant the smaller the market capitalization of a corporate issuer. The “smaller” 13F filers, defined based on the proposed amendment as those with less than $3.5 billion in assets to $100 million in assets, are the targeted audience for micro, small and mid -cap companies. There are more companies in these market cap ranges than in the large and mega cap catego ries. As a result, the proposal impacts a much larger audience of issuers that need investor information . NIRI Virtual Chapter Opposition to Proposed Change in Threshold for 13F filers Release No . 34-89290; File No. S7 -08-20 Page 2 of 2 The drive for transparency in disclosure by issuers is intended to improve capital market efficiency and protect the individual holders. One of the core objectives of investor relations is to assist in the information discovery process on behalf of issuers and is critical to the efficiency of our capital markets. We target the investors with the greatest propensity to invest in each company by understanding what other investments they are making. The importance of institution al investors ownership information is substantiated by the significant number of services that are available to aggregate and analyze the date. The Contradiction Regarding Transparency and the Distraction of Superfl uous Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the glo bal COVID -19 pandemic. Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” a nd using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long -term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes issuers to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fu nd managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of a company ’s long-term strategy or even the investment strategy of long-term investors. According to Activist Insight , 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted, and 95 proxy contests were launched. Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was aft er the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors. Recommendation to Withdraw Proposed Form 13F Amendments and Institute Consistent Modernization and Transparency For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we suggest the SEC recognize the advances in technology since 1978 and promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting more frequent reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45 -day reporting period.

We believe that the SEC's proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds that take positions in our stock. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a company with market capitalization exceeding $10 billion, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciab ly each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.1 1 According to Edelman's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, ""SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy,"" July 29, 2020, available at: htlps://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-proposed­ rule-change-step-193 708183 .html.

Gilmore Road • Fairfield, Ohio 45014-5141 mike_sewell@cinfin.com • 513-603-5075 Office Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission's proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicable11 to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies.

While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules1 we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company1s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors! and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission1s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies1 5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,6 and the proposed updates to SEC's rules on shareholder resolutions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. 8 Rather than reduce 13F 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post-Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://g4blog.com/2020/05/12/activism-in-the-post-pandemic-market-what-you-need-to-know/; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secretary, ""How boards can prepare for post-pandemic activism,"" April 6, 2020; available at: https://www.cor:poratesecretary.com/articles/boardroom/32040/how-boards­ can-prepare-post-pandemic-activism. 5 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33- 10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-16 (March 31, 2017). 6 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 7 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, File No: S7-23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) {The Commission proposed to increase the minimum holding requirement for shareholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company's shares for at least three years.) 8 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance, Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(l) of Rule 13f-l, Petition No. 4-659, February 4, 2013, available at: htn,s://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-659.pdf; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/ru1es/petitions/2015/petn4-689.pdf.; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4-691, December 7, 2015, available at htn,s://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4-691.pdf. 3 transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

Our Committee is composed of experienced attorneys whose practices focus on merger and acquisition transactions and related corporate law, corporate governance and securities regulation matters. Our Committee includes lawyers with diverse pe rspectives on corporate and securities law issues, including partners at law firms and in-house counsel to issuers, investors a nd financial advisors. We are responding to the request of the Securiti es and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) for comment on the proposed update to the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment manage rs, as described in Release N o. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 (the “Release”). We believe that increasing the threshold for fili ng from $100 million to $3.5 billion would directly contravene Congress’s stated purpose of adopti ng Section 13(f) of the S ecurities and Exchange Act of 1934—specifically, to narrow the “gaps in information about the purchase, sale and COMMITTEE ON MERGERS , ACQUISITIONS AND CORPORATE CONTROL CONTESTS BARBARA L. BECKER CHAIR GIBSON , DUNN & CRUTCHER LLP 200 PARK AVENUE NEW YORK, NY 10166-0193 2 holdings of securities by major classes of institutional investors.”1 As the Release notes, the Section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary policy goa ls quoted below in support of Congress’s stated purpose.2 We do not believe these goals w ould be served by the proposal. • “First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of instituti onal investment managers.” • As described in the Release, the updated thresh old would eliminate filings from nearly 90% of institutional investment managers currently filing Forms 13F. The Commission noted in the Release that inve stors have other sources of information to understand the activities of institutional investment manage rs, such as Form N-PORT, which requires investment companies to prepare monthly hol dings reports and to submit them to the Commission on a quarterly basis, and which the Commission makes available to the public on a 60-day delay. However, ma ny smaller investment manage rs may not be registered with the Commission and so would no longer be subject to any reporting requirements. We share the concern raised by Commissioner Lee th at the proposal “would eliminate access to information about discretionary accounts managed by more than 4,500 institutional investment managers representing a pproximately $2.3 trillion in assets” 3 on which lawmakers and regulators depend to adva nce the policy goals of Section 13(f). • “Second, to improve the body of factual data av ailable regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus fa cilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securiti es markets and the public policy implications of that influence.” • Entire segments of the investment management market would likely be removed from the Section 13(f) reporting require ments by the proposal set fort h in the Release, which may disable policymakers from unde rstanding the influence of institutional investment managers on the securities markets. Prelimin ary analyses of the Release note that small investment managers tend to invest in companies with sm aller market cap italizations.4 Much of the information flow regarding these smaller companies, and hence the ability of 1 See Release at 7 n.10, 8 n.19 (citing 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1)); see also Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release No. 14852, 43 Fed.

COMM ’N (July 10, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10 (all websites last visited on August 20, 2020). 4 Ben Ashwell, Issuers and Investors Express Concerns About SEC’s Proposed 13F Rule Change , IR MAGAZINE (July 17, 2020), https://www.irmagazine.com/regulation /issuers-and-investors-express-concer ns-about-secs-proposed-13f-rule-chang e. 3 the companies, their shareholders and securi ties regulators to evalua te trading behavior across the broad market segment comprised by such companies, w ould be lost as a result of implementing the higher reporting threshold. One survey of 70 consumer services companies reviewed the top 100 shareholde rs of such companie s to assess how many shareholders had assets under management of less than $3.5 billion.5 The proportion for companies with a market capit alization over $40 billion wa s only 3%, but for companies with a market capitalization of less than $1 billion, the proportion rose to 23%. The proposed dramatic shift in di sclosure requiremen ts means that regulators may lose a window into understanding how those smaller asset managers behave and what impact they have on smaller issuers. In addition, sm aller issuers will lose access to information about their respective shareholder bases that can be important to boards and management in shareholder engagement efforts. • The Committee is also concerned that the proposed threshold seeks to establish an inapt equivalency in market impact rely ing largely on total equity valu es at the time of adoption and at present day. The landscape of both passive and active investing has changed significantly since Section 13(f) was adopted, as has the concentration of capital among larger investment managers and public companies. We are concerned that the Commission’s reliance on this simplified metric of the change in market size, without considering participant behavior, may have unintended consequences for policymaking in other arenas. • “Third, to increase investor c onfidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” • It is difficult to reconcile this policy goal w ith the proposal set fort h in the Release. By increasing the threshold for filing to $3.5 billion, all but the appr oximately 550 largest investment managers would be able to accumulate significan t stakes in public companies without a public reporting obligation. 6 As such, many of the most prolific investors whose trading activities have signifi cant impacts on individual public companies as well as the market as a whole would be free from quarterly disclosure obligations. The only remaining entities still consistently reporting on Form 13F would predominantly be large index funds and other passive investors not ordinarily involved in price discovery. As a result, investors would be left with an incomplete view of the asset management ma rket by virtue of the implementation of the proposal set forth in the Release. • In addition, the Commission’s suggestion in the Release that raising the reporting threshold 5 Alexander Yokum, SEC Proposes Boosting the 13F Reporting Threshold—Potential Impact, LINKED IN (July 13, 2020), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sec-proposes-boosting-13f-reporting-threshold-potential-yokum . 6 For example, the Release describes that the value of the public equity markets has increased from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion between the time Rule 13f-1 was adopted to 2019, see Release at 11 Fig. 2; however, this increase is driven solely by the value of publicly traded companies in the U. S. having significantly increased as the number of public companies is fewer than it was in 1979. As such, the 5% threshold that would trigger the filing of a Schedule 13D or 13G tends to represent a much more significant investment than most investors will make in a public company. 4 on Form 13F may be useful in reduci ng “front-running” and “copycatting” among investment managers appears unlikely given the ti me lag between when an investment position is assembled and when it is disclosed on Form 13F and the absence of evidence offered for that assertion in the Release. In our view, the modest expense incurred by managers in complying with Rule 13f-1 is significantly outweighed by the benefit to market participants and policymakers of ensuring that the trading activities of these investors remain tr ansparent. We believe that the markets would be better served if the Commission in stead refocused on previously advanced proposals to shorten the time lag between when an investment position is assembled and when it is disclosed on Form 13F. 7 These proposals would increase the transparency of the positions taken by asset managers and so would make the 13F reporting system more useful to companies, investors and policymakers alike. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to par ticipate in this proc ess, and would be pl eased to discuss our comments or any questions the Com mission or its staff may have.

This proposed rule change represents backsliding and a disconcerting drive for more opacity. Transparency in capital markets is more important than ever, particularly as it involves the interplay between financial investment, government and lobbying. Transparency in capital markets, most importantly, can reveal potential conflicts of interests both domestically and internationally. Capital pools can take equity positions and then lobby government/s to advance their positions through regulatory change, enforcement against competitors, trade deals, foreign policy and even war. Hedge funds in the United State already have a well known track record of lobbying governments to affect their investments. Americans should know the motives, and particularly the financial motives, of all financial influencers. Capital funds can also lobby foreign governments and, importantly, lobby the United States on behalf of foreign governments. Americans, the governments themselves, and the capital markets will operate more efficiently when these motives cannot be hidden from public view. Mark Pedroli, Esq."

They provide transparency and increase trust in the US capital markets, the largest and most important in the world. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that such filings improve market efficiency and price discovery, helping to direct capital flows to the most productive investment opportunities. Raising the reporting threshold would significantly reduce the level of information available from smaller funds, which are some of the most important as they can invest smaller amounts of capital in smaller/mid sized companies that are the innovators and leaders of tomorrow.

We urge the SEC to reconsider implementing this proposed rule change and instead require more frequent disclosures and lowering the threshold for reporting to $25 million in assets under management. As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts -as it is the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around holdings and significantly undermine our investor engagement efforts. The SEC proposal will reduce transparency by raising the $100 million assets under management threshold to $3.5 billion. The potential impact to market transparency and the investor relations function cannot be understated: • The data submitted within 13F filings represents the only accurate source of institutional investor holdings available to public companies. Without this data, public companies would face a significant loss in market transparency into their holders. • Approximately 90% or 4,500 of the current estimated 5,000 13F filers would no longer be required to disclose holdings on Form 13F, leaving only 500 of the largest fund managers to provide this important information to the market, severely limiting transparency and creating a disadvantage to the largest holders. • The reduction in the number of filers will likely have a disproportionate impact on smaller public companies as lower float and trading liquidity of small caps makes them less attractive to larger institutional managers. • A reduction in an issuer's knowledge regarding the shareholder base will make allocating management time and scarce investor relations resources more difficult. • Lack of transparency regarding public companies' shareholder bases will make proxy issues more difficult to address and place companies at a disadvantage when it comes to shareholder activism. The impact of this proposed change seems incongruent with the SE C's mission to ""protect investors , maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. "" We also fail to see how eliminating 90% of the public disclosure of holding by institutions furthers the SEC's vision to ""promote capital markets that inspire public confidence and provide a diverse array of financial opportunit ies to retail and institutional investors, entrepreneurs, public companies, and other market participants.''1 The significant decrease in oversight and disclosure of the proposed rule change seems antithetical to the mission of the SEC in that less information and transparency damages public confidence in the markets. We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposed rule change and instead implement reforms designed to increase market transparency, such as those detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq.2 The need for effective shareholder engageme nt is clearer than ever, and this proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency and governance ..

Countryman Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 –1090 August 2 8, 2020 Re: S7– 08–20, Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Dear Ms. Countryman, We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the SEC’s proposal to amend Form 13F and raise the reporting threshold for institutional investment managers from $100 million to $3.5 billi on. We are a group of finance p rofessors at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Collectively, we have published research and advised policymakers on a broad range of issues including market structure, corporate finance, and asset management . In the press release, Chairman Clayton stated that the goal of the SEC’s proposed rule is to “[…] update, for the first time in over 40 years, the 13F reporting threshold to a level that furthers the statutory goal of enabling the SEC to monitor holdings of larger investment managers while reducing u nnecessary burdens on smaller managers.” In the proposal, the Commission further spells out the rationale for adopting the 13F disclosure program in the first place: “The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate considerat ion of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.” We believe that th e substantial increase of the reporting threshold of institutional investment managers is not warranted because (i) the r egulatory burden of quarterly reporting is small in the digital age but (ii) the lost transparency associated with the increase in threshold is very costly. 2 Unclear benefit of reduced regulatory burden We appreciate the SEC’s conscious and continued effort in streamlining and simplifying regulation to the benefit of smaller institutional investors. That said, the logic of increasing the regulatory reporting threshold in tandem with the equity market valuation over the last four decades misses the important fact that , thanks to the digital revolution, the direct costs of electronic data processing, storage, and transmission have fallen by several orders of magnitude over the same period . Because asset managers generate and submit similar information for their own investors anyway, it is not clear that quarterly filing of form 13F incurs an incremental cost, even for the small asset managers. Moreover, the current disclosures in form 13F are already quite limited in scope and frequency. For example, it does not ask investment managers to disclose short positions in equities , positions in most fixed -income securities , or positions in derivatives. Quarterly filing and the 45 -day delay already build in a safety valve against leaking commercially valuable proprietary strategies. If investment managers wish to further reduce information leakage, the current SEC rules allow them to request permission from the SEC to further delay their disclosures and achieve de facto delays while the SEC’s decision is pending. Academic evidence has shown that some investment managers, in particular hedge funds, actively take this approach and that their “hidden portfolios” earn excess returns (see Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang 2013; Aragon, Hertzel, and Shi 2013) .1 In other words, investment managers are already actively managing and mitigating the risk of information leakage and “ front running ” (if any). Finally, the regulatory and compliance cost of 13F reporting seems much smaller compared to some other initiatives of the SEC. For example, the SEC’s recent consolidated audit trail (CAT, 2016) seems much more burdensome for market participants because all events must be recorded (e.g. canceling an order). The compliance cost for form 13F seems trivial compared to that for CAT. Large Cost of Reduced Transparency On the other hand, the substantial increase in the 13F reporting threshold inc urs large and tangible costs. A major cost is the lost market transparency for many investment managers that are important in dimensions other than size. For example, proprietary trading firms are highly active players in quantitative trading strategies an d high- frequency liquidity provision, but they need not be large under conventional measures. For instance, as of Q2 1 See A garwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang, 2013 , “Uncovering hedge fund skill from the portfolio holdings they hide. ” Journal of Finance, 68(2), 739 -783; Aragon, Hertzel, and S hi, 2013, “ Why do hedge funds avoid disclosure? Evidence from confidential 13F filings. ” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 48(5), 1499- 1518. 3 2020, Virtu Financial and Tower Research reported asset positions of $865,348,000 and $2,436,580,000, respectively.2 Should the threshold b e raised to $3.5 billion, both firms would no longer be required to file form 13F. This example is not meant to single out individual firms or proprietary trading firms in general, but illustrate the risk of losing track of some major market participants. A related case in mind is the October 2014 Flash Rally event in U.S. Treasury market, when the yield on the 10 -year Treasury note experienced a range of 37 bps. Only after that event did U.S. regulators realize the jarring data gap in the world’s most liquid market; even the official sector did not have the Treasury market data readily at hand to analyze the event of the day. In the subsequent joint staff report, five regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Treasury and the SEC, find that the growth of proprietary trading firms has fundamentally changed the landscape of U.S. Treasury market. The start of TRACE data collection of Treasury trades implemented by FINRA can be largely read as a response, if not a remedy, to the Flash Rally event. This episode highlights the risks, including financial stability risks, associated with gaps in data collection. Missing data means missing evidence and insights. For decades, academic research has used form 13F information to s hed light on a host of questions related to investment management . A Google Scholar search of “SEC 13F” yields over 20,000 research publications and working papers. For example, using 13F data, Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004)3 and Ben- David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2012)4 examine the behavior of hedge funds in the technology bubble and the financial crisis of 2007 -09, respectively. B rav, Jiang, and Kim (2010)5 survey the literature on hedge fund activism, which relies heavily on 1 3F data. Schmidt and Fahlen brach (2017)6 use 13F data to study how ownership by passive investors affects corporate governance. There are many other examples. Summary In conclusion, we believe that the proposed rule reduces compliance cost by a very narrow margin at best, but it significantly reduces the transparency of U.S. capital markets . Hence, the proposed rule goes against the very purpose of adopting 13F in the f irst place. W e recommend the SEC not to proceed with it. 2 See https://fintel.io/i13fs/virtu -financial -llc and https://fintel.io/i13fs/tower- research -capital -llc-trc-. 3 Brunnermeier and Na gel, 2004, “Hedge Funds and the Technology Bubble.” Journal of Finance, 59, 2013 -2040. 4 Ben-David , Franzoni , and Moussawi , 2012, “Hedge Fund Stock Trading in the Financial Crisis of 2007– 2009.” Review of Financial Studies, 25, 1- 54. 5 Brav, Jiang, and Kim , 2010, ""Hedge Fund Activism: A Review.""

While we welcome the Commission’s interest in modernizing 13F reporting , we believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around hedge fund activism, significantly undermine issuer -investor engagement , and deprive retail investors of information they use to make investment decisions. We urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal and instead consider the common -sense reforms that were detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .1 Rather than allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, we urge the Commission to reduce the archaic 45 -day reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions, and support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure.2 1 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and the Society for Corporate Governance , Request for Rulemaking Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Order to Shorten the Reporting Deadline under Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No. 4 -689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity with Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, December 7, 2015, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -691.pdf . 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for 13F filers to provide more disclosure . Section 929X of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 called for monthly disclosure of short position s, while National Investor Relations Institute 225 Reinekers Lane, Suite 560 , Alexandria, VA 22314 (703) 562 -7700 FAX (703) 562 -7701 Website: www.niri.org 2 Since the Commission’s Form 13F rules were adopted more than 40 years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in engagement between in stitutional in vestors and the public companies with whom they invest . Investors have become more active in engaging with issuers on many important matters, including capital allocation decisions, long -term strategy, M&A, and ESG risks and opportunities . In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most important duties of these IR professionals is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C -suite executives or directors . At most companies , the volume of requests far exceeds the scarce executive (or director) time available for such engagement, so IR professionals have to help decide which investors should have priority. To make these determinations, most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings , the only accurate source available .3 The Commission’s propo sed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust engagement by U.S. companies by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include a number of well -known hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long -term basis.4 While companies would continue to receive information from the largest inv estors, many of th ose institutions are passive , indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is mo re valuable.5 Small and mid -cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially hard hit by this loss of transparency . Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of proxy votes on executive c ompensation . 3 Unfortunately , companies cannot simply accept investors’ representations at face value. In a 2016 survey of NIRI members, 45 percent said they definitely had experiences with investors who misrepresented their positions to obtain meetings with C -suite executives, while another 31 percent said they suspected that had happened. 4 See, e.g., Bloomberg News (Quint), “Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC Plan,” July 15, 2020, available at https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/tepper -einhorn -soros -stock -holdings -would -go- dark-in-sec-plan. 5 According to an IHS Markit analysis of the Russell 3000, an average company would lose visibility into 55 percent of its current 13F filers and 69 percent of the hedge funds on its 13F list. IHS Markit, ""SEC’s 13F Proposal – Issuer and Investor Analysis,"" August 7, 2020, available at: https://ipreo.com/blog/secs -13f-proposal -issuer -and-investor - analysis/ . 3 that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds tri ggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surface s with a 5 percent (or more) position .6 The Commission also ha s not fully considered the negative impact of raising the 13F threshold on retail investors and small asset managers , many of whom use 13F data when making investment decisions .7 For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 1 3F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer -investor engagement.

See Barron's , ""Hostile Bidders Are Ready to Pounce on Struggling Companies.

Many investors review 13F data before making trading decisions, just as they monitor Form 4 data on stock trades by co rporate insiders . When the Commission reduced the Form 4 reporting period to two business days in 2002 , the SEC touted the benefits of greater ownership transparency: “Making this information available to all investors on a more timely basis should increase market transparency, which will likely enhance market efficiency and liquidity.” Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Release Nos. 34 -46421; 35 -27563; File No. S7 -31-02, August 29, 2002. 4 AMETEK, Inc.

Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 CYPRESS F 'VIRONMF 'TAI August 28, 2020 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers Release No. 34-89290 (the ""Proposing Release"") File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman : On behalf of Cypress Environmental Partners, L.P. (NYSE: CELP), headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, I am submitting this letter to express our opposition to the proposed amendments by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the proposed rules should not be adopted because they are contrary to the principles of market transparency and fairness. The Proposing Release provides that money managers holding less than $3.5 billion of ""13(f) securities"" would be exempt from filing Form 13F. We believe this increase in the filing threshold from $ 100 million would decrease the number of reporting filers by almost 90% ( or approximately 4,500 institutional investment managers according to SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee's public statement opposing the proposed revisions to Rule 13f-1). The SEC's proposal would effectively abolish Form 13F as a reporting system for most investors, including many activists and event-driven hedge funds, and preserve it only for the largest index funds and asset managers. We believe the SEC's proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company's institutional investors, hinder shareholder /public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated and/or activist investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling U.S. issuer shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Further, the reports are particularly useful for smaller issuers like us that may not be able to afford more costly stock-surveillance programs. Without the reports, issuers would be left to rely on Schedule 13D and 13G reports filed by beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of their stock. This, in turn, would limit issuers' ability to track ownership changes or to verify how much of their stock is owned by investors who refuse to disclose their stakes. Cypress Environmenta l Partners, L.P. 5727 South Lewis Avenue, Suite 300 Tulsa, Oklahoma 74105 www.cypressenvironmental.biz Richard M. Carson Senior Vice President and General Counsel Direct Dial: 918-748-3912 richard@cypressenvironmental.biz Letter to Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman August 28, 2020 Page 2 While we agree the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on the ability of U.S. issuers to engage effectively with shareholders , attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the rather modest cost savings for investment managers . The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules and certainly isn't an inflationary adjustment which would make more sense. The Proposing Release is a remarkable development at a time when the overall trend in the United States as it relates to issuers, investors, regulated reporting and governance is toward more, not less, public disclosure . For the reasons noted above, we request the SEC withdraw its proposed 13F amendments. Rather than reduce 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by pursuing reforms (such as monthly reporting and reduction of the 45-day reporting period) as detailed in rule making petitions submitted by NYSE Euronext , the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals , and others. Very truly yours, ~ Richard M. Carson Senior Vice President and General Counsel"
"Chris Kettmann & Nathan Elwell, Co-Founders and Partners, Lincoln Churchill Advisors",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7707475-222889.pdf,,"August 28, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34 - 89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Lincoln Churchill Advisors , a strategic communications firm headquartered in Evanston, IL , we are writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. All of our clients are public companies and rely on quarterly 13F filing information to understand their institutional shareholder ownership . We b elieve that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to essentially disappear from public view , would result in a significant loss of market transparency for all public ly traded companies . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders , impede our clients’ ability to attract new long-term investors and deprive us of timely information about activist investors that take positions in our clients’ stock . We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to public companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors. We work predominately with small - and mid -cap companies and are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our clients’ most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency On behalf of our clients, we use 1 3F data to prioritize and allocate the limited time of senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on-one calls or meetings. The current system of 13F filings allows us to ascertain the quality of potential shareholders based on their track record of ownership with other stocks, including smaller firms 2 who are interested in buying the stocks of our c lients . With this proposed in crease in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our clients ’ ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers , we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our clients to effec tively access the capital markets. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying shares each quarter would hinder their ability to continue to compete for and raise capital. As required by the agency’s missi on, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID -19 pandemic. Just as there is a need for greater transparency to investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share declines to amass larger stakes in target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to mo nitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit - not that of our clients’ long-term shareholders. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of activism by short -term-oriented fund managers who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part of their long-term strategy. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched. Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for anoth er surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for these companies.

As an individual investor, the ability to confirm some of my own research by being able to see how like-minded investors are managing their portfolio is an incredible advantage and confidence boost. In light of the information age, the fact that we would be restricting information seems like the antithesis of what the SEC has tried to do over the course of the last 40+ years. Transparency has always been at the forefront of what the SEC has tried to provide to investors to ensure that they were not being taken advantage of and a change in the reporting rule seems like a total about face. Additionally, with Wall Street being massively under the microscope with the recent political turmoil, how does less transparency help to assuage the masses who feel like Wall Street is a ""Boys Club"" that is only out for themselves. I strongly hope that you reconsider, and leave the filing rule at its current threshold.Warmest Regards,Jonathan M. Drujak, P.E."

Adjusting the reporting threshold solely based on increases in market size ignores and does not account for the increasing ownership of the market by institutional investors. If one of the goals of the 13(f) disclosure program is to ""facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence."", then some compensating factor which would lower the disclosure threshold from $3.5 billion should be included. If the intent of the proposed change is to lessen the burden of compliance on small managers, another reasonable methodology that accounts for the public's right to this information is to compare the marginal gain to institutional investors and marginal loss of information to individual investors by raising the threshold. According to Table 1 of the proposal, by tripling the reporting threshold to $300 million, the number of required filers would decrease by half. It would take increasing the threshold to $1 billion to reduce the number of filers by 75%. A proposal that minimized the number of filers, while maximizing the information available to the public would have been more reasonable than the current one."

We believe that the SEC’s proposal, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company along with many others . The proposed rule, if enacted, would deprive us of timely information about investment funds that may make significant investments in our s hares and impair engagement with shareholders about our long -term strategy and corporate governance. Public companies, such as ourselves and others, are not well serv ed by providing anonymity to institutional investment managers. How can we effectively communicate with our shareholders if we do not know who owns our shares? The current 13F reporting allows companies insight into who is holding its shares and engage in shareholder communication. Of our top 15 shareholders, 6 would no longer be required to file under the rule change. This data cannot be replaced by hiring sto ck surveillance firms, which also rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Additionally, stock surveillance firms are quite costly for small cap stocks with limited budgets and many companies like us forgo services that may be able to provide some incremental visibility. As such, we ask that the SEC withdraw this proposal given that knowledge of share ownership is essential for effective shareholder outreach. Sincerely, Barbara G.

We b elieve that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 % of current 13F filers to avoid disclosure , would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public ly traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new investors, unnecessarily weaken capital formation and prudent corporate governance, and deprive us of timely information about activist hedge funds. T he 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to public companies. Monitoring the investor bas e is a fundamental and critical activity of a public company, and the inability to identify investors would have negative consequences. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 36 percent of our current top 25 investors to evade disclosure. O ur company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on- one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. W e do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on public compan ies and their obligation to regularly confer with in vestors throughout the year. Like many other small and medium sized companies, we at Hannon Armstrong (with ~$2.5 billion market cap) are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders , engage effectively with them, and measure the effectiveness of our shareholder DocuSign Envelope ID: ACC14308-9D37-4D4A-AAC1-D3020CB703AD 1906 Towne Centre Blvd., Suite 370 • Annapolis, MD 21401 • (410) 571 – 9860 • www.hannonarmstrong.com outreach . These practices are essential for smaller compan ies like ours to effectively access the capital markets and grow their business es. The loss of 1 3F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effec tiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holdin g as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding wi th this rulemaking. Many companies actively reach out to shareholders to ensure their concerns are being addressed. This active outreach, which is often referenced in the proxy, is intended to improve corporate governance and align management with shareho lders. Without the 13F filings, corporations , especially smaller companies , would not have the ability to identify and engage many of their top 100 shareholders on these critical topics. Increased Risk of Activism The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short -term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce funding of critical long -term initiatives , increase share buybacks, or take other measure s that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long -term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched .1 Many corp orate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021 -22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008 -09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long -term investors .2 Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position.

Investors have become more active in engaging with issuers on many important matters, including capital allocation decisions, long-term strategy, M&A, and corporate governance. In response, companies have hired and/or engaged investor relations professionals to ensure that the concerns of investors are heard and conveyed to senior executives and directors. One of the most important duties of these IR professionals is to respond promptly to requests from investors for calls or meetings with C-suite executives or directors. At most companies, the volume of requests far exceeds the scarce executive (or director) time available for such engagement, so IR professionals have to help decide which investors should have priority. To make these determinations, most U.S. issuers rely heavily on the quarterly ownership information in 13F filings, the only accurate source available.3 The Commission's proposed amendments would seriously jeopardize the robust engagement by U.S. companies by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers from disclosure. These managers include a number of well-known hedge fund executives and billionaire investors who fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold because they do not hold a significant volume of 13(f) securities on a long-term basis.4 While companies would continue to receive information from the largest investors, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For many companies, it is the 13F data from the more active investment managers under the $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable. Small and mid-cap issuers, which typically have a greater percentage of these investors, would be especially 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for l3F filers to provide more disclosure. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of20l0 called for monthly disclosure of short positions, while Section 951 mandated annual disclosure of Say on Pay votes. 3 Unfortunately, companies cannot simply accept investors' representations at face value. In a 2016 survey ofNIRI members, 45 percent said they definitely had experiences with investors who misrepresented their positions to obtain meetings with C-suite executives, while another 31 percent said they suspected that had happened. 4 See, e.g., Bloomberg News (Quint), ""Tepper, Einhorn, Soros Stock Holdings Would Go Dark in SEC Plan,"" July 15, 2020, available at https://www.bloombergqui111.com /markets/tepper-einhorn ­ soros-stock-holdings-would-go-dark-in-sec-plan . hard hit by this loss oftransparency.5 Without that 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds that are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent ( or more) position.6 The Commission also has not fully considered the negative impact of raising the 13F threshold on retail investors and small asset managers, many of whom use 13F data when making investment decisions.7 For the foregoing reasons, we urge the Commission not to adopt a 35-times increase in the 13F threshold and instead implement the reforms proposed by NIRI, the NYSE Group, NASDAQ, and other organizations to improve market transparency and foster more effective issuer-investor engagement.

Countryman Securities & Exchange Commission 100 F Street N E Washington , DC 20549 -1090 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman , On behalf of Badger Meter, Inc, (NYSE: BMI) I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’ s proposal, which would allow nearly 90% of current 13F filers to avoid reporting, would add considerably to the current lack of transparency associated with the p roliferation of dark pools, algorithmic and high -frequency trading, and the 45 -day lag with c urrent 13F filing requirement s. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede our ability to attract new long -term investors, and deprive us of timely information about potential activist hedge fund stakes in our company . 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company. While 13F data is not as timely as we would like, it is the only snapshot of data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling ou r shares each quarter. This information cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, at a sizable fee, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for the research efforts. While the proposal cites as a benefit the reduce d burden for smaller asset managers, the reality is that technology advancements in the years since the 13F rule was put in place make it markedly easier and have lessened the burden to the point it would not be unreasonable for these firms to report daily if not hourly positions. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly dialogue with our investors throughout the year. As a <$2 billion market cap company, we are particularly concerned with how the reduction in transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose s hares held, many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company, and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3 .5 billion threshold that is of most value. Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we received from investors for call and meetings. We c annot possibly say yes to every investor request, so we attempt to give priority to not only our largest investors, but also to those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings. With this proposal, we would not hav e visibility into this important subset of investors. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data would also impede our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we utilize 13F information to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency of who is holding , as well as buying/selling our shares each quarter , would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. Increased Risk of A ctivism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures and thus transparency, is at odds with recent request by the SEC that public companies “provide as much information as is practical” to investors amid market uncertainty caused by th e global COVID -19 pandemic. Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high. Activist investors could take advantage of t hat volatility, using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of long -term shareholders. The loss of 13 F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of “ambush” activism by short -term oriented fund managers who may demand we eliminate jobs, reduce R&D funding, increase share repurchases or other measure not in the best interest of long - term shareholders. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendme nts and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by the National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE, the Society for Corporate Governance and NASDAQ. Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote mor e timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring public disclosure of short positions, and shortening the current 45-day reporting period.

The increase would greatly reduce market transparency and essentially eliminate the primary tool used by most public companies to 1) identify and engage with long-term investors and 2) monitor the activity of potential activists. The increased threshold is of particular concern to smaller issuers that cannot justify the expense of stock surveillance firms to analyze trading patterns and try to determine which investors are buying or selling shares. The proposed rule change ignores the reality of todays market, where small but vocal participants can wield a disproportionate influence over public companies, often to the detriment of other shareholders.

If anything, the Commission should be increasing transparency by reducing the AUM threshold and mandating disclosure for short exposure. The current proposal is the exact opposite of what they should be considering."

We are submitting this letter on behalf of MVW alone to provide the Commission with a more detailed perspective regarding the adverse impact the proposed amendments could have on companies like ours. MVW became one of the first stand-alone publicly traded vacation ownership companies through a spin-off from Marriott International, Inc. in November 2011. Only a handful of publicly traded vacation ownership companies (including MVW) exist today, and their combined market capitalization is just $8.5 billion. Because the vacation ownership business is relatively small and differs so substantially from other sectors of the hospitality industry, it is often misunderstood by investors and potential investors and requires substantial education by issuers in the industry. For these reasons, shareholder engagement is crucial, and we extensively use 13F filings to aid in our shareholder targeting efforts, as they are the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. Based on reporting data, there were 406 institutional holders of MVW as of August 17, 2020. If the Commission's proposal were enacted, we would lose visibility on approximately 184 of our shareholders that are currently 13F filers, or 45% of total current 13F filers, which would cause us to substantially reduce our current level of shareholder engagement. 6649 Westwood Boulevard, Orlando, Florida 32821 1: 407-206-6000 marriottvacationsworldwide .com Proud supporter of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals ,, ,, _,s - ,\\arnoll \I,,, ,_1_1 ... Page 2 We believe this would be a significant adverse result for both MVW and our shareholders. Enactment of the Commission's proposal would also potentially cause us to have to engage costly surveillance services, which, in our experience, ·have varying levels of accuracy. Regarding the Commission's rationale that the a·mendments are justified because the size of the market has grown over 30 times since the current reporting threshold was established, we believe this fails to consider how much the makeup of the marketplace itself has changed during that same period. Specifically, there has been a proliferation of alternative asset managers, including hedge funds. The number of hedge funds has grown from 140 identified by the Commission in 1968, to over 10,000 active hedge funds today, with more than $3.2 trillion of assets under management. These alternative asset managers, many of which have assets under management of well below $3.5 billion, often represent a sizable percentage of the shareholders of publicly traded small and mid size issuers such as MVW. These alternative asset managers tend to trade their positions more often than traditional asset managers, causing undue volatility in the share prices of companies whose stock is being traded. As of August 17, 2020, hedge funds represented 12% of MVW reported shares outstanding based on the latest 13F filings; 68% of these hedge funds manage under $3.5 billion. Unfortunately, were the proposed rule to pass, we would have no information about these investors and would be forced to curtail our engagement with these and other asset manag·ers that fall below the proposed new threshold. Finally, we believe that the long-term impact of the amendment proposed by the Commission will be detrimental to public markets in the U.S., as this proposal could deter private companies from going public or prompt them to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency around rep·orting disclosures. For the reasons set for above (as well as those set forth in the letter previously submitted by NIRI), we respectfully ask that the Commission reconsider the implications of this proposed rule amendment and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of 13F disclosure requirements to improve transpl;l,rency. We believe that the proposed amendment represents a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency and therefore urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Thank you for your consideration. Steph P. Weisz President & CEO"

I would like to add my voice during this 60 day public comment period in opposition to this proposed change. Raising the reporting threshold to 3.5 billion would reduce transparency and increase information asymmetry within wall street and main street. It is my understanding that raising the proposed threshold to $3.5 billion is based on public equity growth models from 1975 through 2018. With this in mind, I believe it's also important to recognize another significant change since 1975. Wealth inequality has exploded from almost this exact year. Middle income wages grew close to 50%during this same time period, yet high income wages grew 80%, and the top percent of wages grew on average over 200%. A prime example of wealth inequality is highlighted when examining CEO wages, compared against the lowest salary earners in their same company. Raising the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion would greatly decrease trust of the public markets. Average consumers and investors would find themselves at significant information disadvantages when attempting to identify where to spend and invest their money. Maintaining the reporting threshold at 100 million would continue to provide transparency within wall street, and continue to allow information availability on main street. Thank you for your time.

This system was put in place to help the average investor achieve a more level playing field and benefit by seeing what the professionals are buying and selling. By raising that threshold it provides fund managers who have been purposefully keeping their funds under the threshold to avoid reporting the latitude to greatly increase their profits while still not reporting which does not seem benefit anyone other than fund mangers while hurting the average investor. Many of us rely on following these larger investors for a view of the market health and overall direction as well as identifying opportunities and re-evaluating current positions and disposition. While larger institutions make major moves within the market which create the large waves we rely on still being able to follow the smaller and nimbler investors to find our best strategies. In conclusion, I wish to say I do not see a benefit to the general public by raising the limit and believe it will hurt investors who do not want to utilize large funds to manage their investments and pay what is essentially a tax for it. For those of us who are too small to be able to enter a hedge fund, but do not wish to entrust our retirements to people who get paid whether they provide a return or not, the ability to track the moves of these smaller individual investors and funds is critical. I implore you not to make this change. Thank you."

We believe that the SEC's proposal, which would allow 89 percent of cunent 13F filers to go dai·k, would result in a significai1t loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. If enacted, the proposed rule would impair engagement with shai·eholders and impede our ability to attract new long-term investors. The 13F filings ai·e the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling om shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance fi1111s, which themselves rely on quarterly 13 F data as a stai·ting point for their reseai·ch efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our compat1y and our obligation to regulai·ly confer with our investors throughout the year. As a billion-dollar company, we ai·e particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify om most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow our top 100 investors to evade disclosure. This is pai·ticularly significant to our company where the top 15 independent shareholders each own 1 % or more of First Pacific. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those institutions ai·e passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quai·ter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active First Pacific Company Limited 24/F Two Exchange Square. 8 Connaught Place, Central.

We cannot 1)()'SSl°b\-y say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management , so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers with a track record of activism but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company's ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use l 3F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for om company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission 's proposal to significantly reduce l 3F disclosmes also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies ""provide as much information as is practicab le"" to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.2 Just as there is a need for greater transparency on om part to om investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high and many activist investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold , we would be unable to monitor those activist investors who would be exempt from reporting their positions, 1 According to Edelman 's financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, ""SEC Proposed Rule Change ls A Step Backwards for Shareholder Democracy ,"" July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com /news/sec-proposed-ru le-change-step-193708183.html. 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporat ion Finance Director William Hinman observed, ""The SEC's three-pa11 mission --maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation, and protect investors --takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure -providing the public with the information necessary to make inforn1ed investment decisions -is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission .... We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicab le regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.""

The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be part o:f aur lang-tenn strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. Accordjng to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.3 Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC's proposed reduction of l 3F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-te1m investors.4 Without the l 3F data we receive now, our company will not know if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company's ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Conm1ission's inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,5 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status, 6 and the proposed updates to SEC's rules on shareholder resolutions.7 3 See Lisa Silvennan, Bloomber g Law, ""Insight: Preparing for Post-Pandemic Corporate Activism,"" May 4, 2020, a vai /able at: h ttps:/ /news. bloom berg law .com/corporate-governance /insight-preparing-for-post-pandemic­ corporate-activ ism. 4 See, e.g., Q4 Blog, ""Activism in the Post-Pandemic Market: What You Need to Know,"" May 12, 2020, available at: https://g4blog.com/2020/05/ 12/acti vism-in-the-post-pandem ic-market-what-you-need-to-know/; Frank Aquila and Melissa Sawyer, Sullivan & Cromwell, Corporate Secrefa,y, ""How boards can prepare for post-pandemic activism,"" April 6, 2020; available at: https :/ /www.corporatesec retarv.com/arti c les/boardroom/3 2 040/how-boards-ca n-prepare-post-pandem i c­ acti vism. 5 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendme nts Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33-10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-l 6 (March 31, 2017). 6 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definition s, Release No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-l 9 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 7 Procedura l Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule l 4a-8, File No: S7-23-I 9 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increase the minimum holding requirement for shareholder 3 For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulernakin g petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq.8 Rather than reduce 13F transpare ncy, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting , requiring the public disclosure of short positions , and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

We also believe (and highlight) that such an increase will raise the operating burden for beneficial asset owners, including our clients, who invest a substantial portion of their capital through small managers and derive utility from the public transparency afforded by 13F disclosure. We do not see how creating a disincentive for beneficial asset owners to invest in a small manager compared to a larger manager serves the longer-term interests of small managers who are cited key beneficiaries of the reporting threshold change advocated by the SEC's proposal. Our comments on the recent 13F proposal are informed by the professional experience and observations of our clients accumulated through multiple decades of investing with small managers as well as making selective long-term oriented investments directly in security markets. Our clients are institutional filers making 13F disclosures on directly held positions as well as consumers of 13F disclosures to support the process of diligence and monitoring for their fund investments, as well as the process of managing their direct risk exposures. 390582v2 We strongly urge the SEC to reconsider its proposal to change the reporting threshold and briefly list our arguments against the proposal below. We also provide a more comprehensive commentary in the body of this comment letter to clarify the rationale and provide support for the views expressed herein. Our principal arguments in favor of maintaining the current reporting threshold are as follows: • Beneficial asset owners, such as our clients, routinely allocate much of their capital to fund managers and use 13F disclosures as an unbiased public source of holdings information to inform due diligence into prospective new managers and support monitoring of their existing manager relationships. This is especially the case for small managers who have limited resources to engage directly to understand and meet individual clients' transparency needs. • Through our clients' own direct experience and dialogue with other institutional filers, we believe that the SEC's concern that the direct and indirect costs associated with 13F compliance are burdensome on small managers is seriously overstated and the typical costs are in practice not material. • The proposal if enacted will effectively eradicate a broad-based, unbiased, and unique public source of institutional holdings information that cannot be substituted, thus diluting the quality of independent research into the role and function of active managers in US capital markets. • Transparency into $2.3 trillion in aggregate market positioning would be lost with disproportionate implication for understanding trading behavior and mitigating security price volatility in the typical US listed equity security by market capitalization. • 13F disclosures serve as the only reliable source of public institutional holdings information for corporate issuers. As market participants with a stake in maintaining diversity in the investment opportunity set represented by US publicly listed corporations, our clients believe there should be transparency for all issuers, regardless of their size, to readily identify a wide cross-section of their shareholder base and direct their shareholder engagement efforts effectively. Effective shareholder engagement allows for more efficient capital markets, reduces the cost of capital for corporates seeking to fund their growth, and this economic growth in tum benefits a diverse community of stakeholders ranging from employees, to pension plans and the investing public. 2 Detailed Rationale & Support for Our Arguments Against the Proposal to Raise the 13F Reporting Threshold Beneficial asset owners who allocate capital to fund managers use 13F disclosures as an unbiased public source of holdings information to inform due diligence into prospective new managers and support monitoring of their existing manager relationships. This is especially the case for small managers who have limited resources or otherwise lack the operational sophistication to engage directly to understand and meet individual clients' transparency needs Historical trends in holdings information can be used to analyze past investment behaviors (such as portfolio construction), performance, and risk attribution at the stock and sector level for active managers, as well as monitor whether managers maintain exposures that are consistent with their stated investment strategy and risk parameters. Removing the sole and trusted source of public transparency would raise not lower the operational cost burden on small managers as well as their clients because these parties will now have to privately negotiate on a one on one basis for increased transparency, execute and monitor non-disclosure agreements to safeguard disclosures that are not in the public domain, and labor to identify and resolve inconsistencies in transparency provided by different managers or to different clients. In some situations, the viable solution will be to establish investment vehicles that allow for full transparency of investment holdings and trading activity only for certain clients, but these are operationally burdensome to administer for all involved. Faced with this menu of alternatives, some clients may simply elect not to incur the additional time and expense to negotiate, diligence, and structure investments with small and less operationally sophisticated managers. We do not believe such an outcome serves the long­ term interests of small managers, which the SEC proposal says it seeks to benefit, or the efficient allocation of capital by investors such our clients into the US equity market. We believe that SEC's stated concern that the direct and indirect costs associated with 13F are burdensome on small managers is not borne out in practice Our clients bear the direct costs of 13F compliance, and they advise us that the compliance related expense associated with 13F requirements is significantly lower than even the low-end estimate cited in the SEC proposal. Our clients' discussions with several small managers further confirm the view that 13F reporting requirements are relatively straightforward and inconsequential to the manager's time allocation and operating overhead. In fact, for many small managers the process is automated and leverages existing systems ofrecord, software, or third-party service provider relationships they need to manage their portfolios and run their 3 businesses in the normal course. Thus, their marginal 13F compliance related costs are trivial. It seems to us that the current SEC cost estimates must assume that a specialized system of records or software needs to be operated for 13F compliance which is not in our experience typical for managers. The SEC has also voiced concern about the indirect costs smaller managers bear in meeting 13F requirements. One such concern is that small funds are potentially disadvantaged due to front-running and copycatting. We believe this concern is overstated and at odds with the trading acumen with which we see small professional money managers operate. Firstly, in almost all cases the 45-day reporting lag for 13F disclosure affords enough time delay to render front-running implausible. That said, ""small"" managers as defined within the SEC proposal also have several cost-effective ways to delay or ~void disclosure of a position. For example, where trades might otherwise be made close to the end of a quarter, the manager can defer their trades to after an end of a calendar quarter to avail themselves of up to a full 13 5 days before the effect of their trading would be disclosed in a 13F. They can also employ effective trading tools or strategies to alter the underlying economic exposure of their holdings, such as using swap transactions or engaging in a ""short sale against the box,"" none of which are currently required to be disclosed in a 13F and thus are not visible to others. Secondly, with respect to the implications of potential copycatters for managers, it is questionable to what extent prospective copycatting benefits or disadvantages small managers. For example, to the extent that copycatting of a manager's position by other investors drives up stock prices, then a small manager can trim their own holdings by selling shares to the copycatters as prices rise. In this way they can benefit by realizing profits on their holdings sooner and potentially also look to repurchase previously sold shares at lower prices when the upward stock price pressure from a temporary surge in demand by copycatting inevitably· abates. To be clear, in our clients' experience small managers are not pervasively utilizing such methods because they are not significantly concerned about indirect costs given the frequency and reporting lag associated with 13F disclosure. However, should they have such concerns they have several readily exercisable tools at their disposal to mitigate these concerns. In supporting the case for indirect costs of compliance the SEC proposal cites an academic paper that purports to attribute 13F disclosure as a reason for decline in hedge fund performance. However, we think any causal linkage between hedge fund performance and 13F disclosures is questionable considering the evolution of the hedge fund industry over the last two decades. Specifically, according to third party research1 between 2001 and 2017 global hedge fund assets 1 Representative research sources include Barclays 2019 Global Hedge Fund Industry Outlook Report and HFR Research. 4 (the majority of which is invested in US markets) grew from $0.5 trillion to $3.2 trillion while the corresponding number of hedge fund operators more than quintupled. A substantial number of these thriving funds have been subject to 13F disclosure requirement for most of their existence and so we find it puzzling how it is possible for the industry and many funds to thrive if 13F disclosure was a material impediment to hedge funds' ability to perform and attract capital. Rather we would argue to those who seek to draw a link between 13F disclosure and trends in hedge fund performance, that factors such as increased competitive intensity2, diminishing investment returns to scale3, and macro conditions4 are more credible causal factors explaining potential sources of headwinds to hedge fund industry performance than the disclosure requirement for 13Fs. Thus, we do not think it is advisable to subjugate market transparency considerations (discussed below) for unsubstantiated and questionable concerns regarding the direct and indirect costs of 13F compliance borne by small managers. The SEC's proposal eliminates public transparency into an unbiased and unique source of institutional holdings information that cannot be substituted 13F data is unique in that it is the only reliable public source of institutional holdings data that is systematically collected from institutional participants. This source is frequently used in academic and market research studies and drives insights from time series and holdings-based analysis that sharpens understanding of collective risk-taking behavior and causal drivers of performance for active managers, including hedge funds and activist investors. It also informs understanding of these managers' role in bridging gaps in market efficiency. Without holdings­ based data analysis, insights are substantially diminished or altogether obfuscated as researchers are forced to rely solely on more questionable sources of performance data (discussed below) and blunt statistical analysis that lack the granularity to discern cause and effect from mere correlation. Contrary to the SEC proposal's assertion, the historical 13F filings disclosure is in our clients' many years of experience investing with funds not readily substitutable by other publicly available or commercial databases of self-reported time series manager data. Specifically, 13F data is free from several sources of bias that are pervasive in other self-reported databases. For example, it is free from selection bias which occurs when managers choose at their discretion when and ifto report in a period, thus limiting the accuracy of the insights that can be drawn from 2 Competitive intensity can be proxied by growth in number of hedge fund operators and adoption of hedge fund strategies by traditional managers. 3 Scale is proxied by assets under management. 4 Specifically, we would argue that a prolonged low interest rate environment, narrow or uneven sources of economic growth and an extended bull market by historical standards (which weighs on profitability of short selling) have served as contributory headwinds for hedge fund performance. 5 time series trends. It is also free from survivorship bias which routinely occurs in commercial databases that purge their databases of historical reporting by managers that have ceased to operate. These sources of bias create material gaps in the historical record that greatly hinder robust study of active manager industry evolution, risk taking, and performance analysis. The proposal would result in loss of visibility into 90% of institutional filers' holdings and their collective $2.3 trillion in market positioning that has implications for the orderly trading of many US listed equity securities. Within its 13F proposal the SEC states its belief that it is only necessary to provide regulators and the public information regarding the equity holdings of large managers that have potential to affect the securities market. Implicit in this statement is that only large managers pose risk to operation of orderly markets for US equity securities while small managers do not. Presumably, this assertion rests on the logic that large investors are more likely to have disruptive market impact as their trades have greater potential to be outsized relative to available market liquidity. We agree that large managers can pose risk, but we also believe that small managers can pose risk to the orderly trading of many US publicly traded securities through the aggregate effect of their collective investment actions borne from optimizing for their individual risk seeking and mitigating preferences. Large funds can be categorized as either passive index investors whose activity mirrors market capitalization weighted indices, or alternatively as sophisticated active market participants who are keenly aware of their footprint in the market and have a strong disincentive to trade frequently in and out of securities due to high friction cost they incur in doing so. These dynamics are markedly different for small and more nimble managers. Firstly, small managers can respond to uncertainty by exiting a position with the expectation of reentering relatively quickly and at low friction costs as the uncertainty dissipates. Secondly, small managers have flexibility to manage relatively concentrated portfolios as they are not bound by the same liquidity constraints as their larger brethren. Concentrated portfolios are attractive to small managers as they offer greater potential to make outsized return, but concentration also exposes small managers to greater risk from individual stock price volatility so they have an increased incentive to mitigate this risk by reducing exposure swiftly when they believe they can. Given these dynamics, individual small and nimble managers often seek to be flexible in their positioning. However, when stocks are significantly owned or traded by more nimble institutional investors, then the collective effect of these managers exercising investment flexibility in response to unexpected news or market events has profoundly disruptive influence on an issuer's stock price. We believe such risk is meaningful for many US listed issuers given the modest market capitalization of a typical corporate issuer compared to the 6 cumulative $2.3 trillion in purchasing power represented by small and nimble managers. Specifically, the median market capitalization of index constituents for the Russell 3000 (a widely used institutional benchmark for the largest and· most investable 3000 US listed stocks) is only $1.5 billion5• Given the modest market capitalization of at least half the investable US listed stocks, collective participation by small and nimble managers can easily represent a substantial percentage of the shares of a typical US listed issuer, and an even higher proportion of their average daily trading volume. We believe that removing holdings disclosure for 90% of institutional filers removes important market transparency by eliminating all investors ability to quantify positioning risks in the stock market. In tum this undermines confidence in investing across a wide cross section of companies by market cap and does a disservice to the vibrancy of the US public markets. 13F's are the only reliable source of public institutional holdings information for corporate issuers and we believe that there should be transparency for corporate issuers to readily identify a diverse cross section of their shareholder base and direct their engagement efforts accordingly to optimize their cost of capital The needs of market transparency and ensuring all participants have confidence to support a well-functioning and two-sided (issuer and investor driven) market are often paramount in establishing necessary disclosure requirements for corporates. To that end, the SEC has mandatory quarterly as well as annual public disclosure requirements for listed corporate issuers where the associated complexity and cost of compliance for issuers can be substantial. Many of these issuers can also credibly argue that certain public disclosure required by regulation or otherwise expected by their public shareholders is not in th~ir direct or immediate interest as it contains information that is sensitive for competitive purposes. In contrast to the SEC's stance in promoting a high standard for corporate disclosure, the current 13F proposal threatens to upend two-sided market transparency by eliminating the ability of corporate issuers to identify a broad cross section of their actively managed institutional shareholders. This in turn undermines an issuers' ability to determine how to effectively engage with their diverse shareholder constituents and thereby reduce their cost of capital. We think such an outcome is highly inequitable and potentially discourages or significantly delays a decision by prospective issuers to make the transition from private to publ~c markets. This is not in the interest of all market participants as it impedes the future vibrancy and breadth of investment opportunity embodied by the US market. We also believe that responsible active managers should welcome the opportunity to constructively engage with the companies in which they invest and should not 5 Source: Bloomberg -RAY Index <Go> Summary Statistics, August 2020 7 support an outcome that obfuscates their public ownership of a company, particularly when the disclosures are not onerous given their infrequency and reporting lag of 45 days. As investors our clients are interested in seeing a well-functioning and two-sided public securities market where corporates can access capital efficiently and drive economic growth. This dynamic not only benefits our clients as capital allocators but also serves the interests of a broad set of constituents, ranging from public company employees to pension plan investors and members of the investing public. We believe the SEC should seek to balance the interests of corporate issuers and a broad cross section of the investment community and not, as the current proposal threatens to do, enact a proposal that would disproportionately disadvantage many constituents with little obvious or substantiated benefit to a single constituency. The SEC's proposal represents a significant step-backward from transparency and, if adopted, will result in less data being available to both small and medium-size advisers and to the general investor. Such a result, we respectfully submit, is very contrary to the mission of the SEC. Very truly yours, Kenneth J. Stuart, Of Counsel 8"

"Mark Collinson, Director at Large – Advocacy, NIRI Orange County",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7666024-222530.pdf,,"August 20, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: The undersigned individuals, who are the leadership of the Orange County of the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) are writing, on behalf of the chapter, to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules (Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20). Our members include investor relations officers and executives from the 62 publicly held companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq that are headquartered in Orange County, California. We also represent investor relations counselors who advise public companies in our area and across the country. The Commission’s proposal, which would raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion, 35 times greater than the current threshold of $100 million, would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark. This higher threshold would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our members’ companies as well as other public companies in the United States. The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders, impede companies’ ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive our members of timely information about activist fund managers that take positions in their companies. We do not believe that the SEC has adequately considered the potential impact of this rulemaking proposal on our members’ companies and their obligation to regularly confer with their investors throughout the year. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our members’ companies as well as other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that companies have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. Many of our chapter members work for (or advise) small- and mid-cap issuers, which typically have a higher percentage of shares owned by investment managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. These smaller companies also have fewer resources to devote to stock surveillance and investor targeting, so they would be especially impacted by the 13F proposal. The Commission should fully evaluate the potential harm to smaller companies and capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. We also agree with Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, who has expressed concern that the proposed 13F amendments would reduce transparency and the public’s access to market information. She also questioned whether the SEC “has the authority to pursue” those changes by pointing out that the “enabling statute, at section 13(f)(1), provides no support for increasing the reporting threshold.”1 2 While our members agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this proposed 13F rulemaking on their ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and monitor activists far outweigh any potential cost savings for investment managers. In addition, the proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules. For the above reasons, we ask the Commission to withdraw the proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor 1 As Commissioner Lee pointed out in her dissenting statement: “To the contrary, the relevant text provides: Every institutional investment manager . . . which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) . . . having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter (emphasis added). The text is clear: Congress set a statutory reporting threshold at $100 million, and the Commission has the authority to lower it. Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, “Statement on the Proposal to Substantially Reduce 13F Reporting,” July 10, 2020, available at: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10. 2 Congress has expressed a clear intent for institutional investment managers to provide more disclosure, rather than less transparency. Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 directed the Commission to require 13F filers to report short positions each month, while Section 951 of Dodd-Frank instructed the SEC to require 13F filers to annually disclose their votes on executive compensation matters. Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, Nasdaq, and the Society for Corporate Governance.3 Rather than reduce transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by working with Congress to support monthly reporting, require the public disclosure of short positions, and reduce the outdated 45-day reporting period. To achieve these objectives, we urge the Commission to convene a public roundtable to hear the views of retail shareholders, institutional investors, issuers, and the exchanges on a wide range of market transparency issues, including potential 13F reforms, proposed rules to address “short and distort” abuses, and the modernization of 13D reporting.4 We believe that such a roundtable would result in more thoughtful rulemaking proposals that would increase transparency, promote engagement, protect retail investors, and foster public company capital formation.

The original threshold was adopted in 1975 to obtain data on bigger institutional investment managers' impact on the US equity market. Since then the market has gone from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion. Yet the threshold being observed has not changed with the market. It makes sense that raising the threshold to closely match the market changes over the past 45 years will take away the burden of reporting from smaller managers such as ourselves and make the data that is collected more relevant to the original intent to monitor the larger institutional managers' influence on the market. I also believe it would be prudent to review the reporting threshold every five years and recommend adjustments accordingly.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. Please consider my following comment on the proposed rule change for 13f release. The proposed rules are anti-competition, anti-free market, and anti-transparency. The current rules are plenty enough to allow hedge funds to get a 6 week start on new investments. Allowing hedge funds under 3.5 billion to hide Their investments (by not releasing them) would close transparency for the markets, and for individual investors. Individual investors are certainly not a threat to the potential profits of hedge funds, as they account for an enormously low amount of investment dollars in the US investment market. The only real threat to hedge funds is the ability of investors to purchase cheap and efficient ETF’s. Hedge funds will always have an edge given their teams of analysts and data crunchers. Cutting out transparency will only hurt the “little guys”. Thank you for considering my comments. Charles Eckhart Sent from my iPhone"

If this were in fact the case, we should first determine how an trader with less than 50 mill AUM could have caused a market wide flash crash in 2010. From my direct experience in trading and investing, I believe that total AUM matters less than how quickly assets are acquired or turned over in a portfolio. I.e. funds with high turn over ratios can affect market prices on an extreme level, and for an extended period of time beyond their holding period, compared to multi billion dollar asset managers that have long-term (e.g. 1 year or more) holding periods. Its my belief that this new proposal will be a great disservice to the transparency, confidence, longterm stability of exchange listed investment vehicles."

As a publicly traded company, we rely on 13F filings to aid in our shareholder engagement efforts – as it is the only accurate source of institutional holdings available. We believe that the proposed amendments would reduce trans parency around holdings, significantly undermining issuer -investor engagement, particularly for small and mid-cap companies such as ours . Based on reporting data dated June 30, 2020, there were 10 institutional holders holding ~ 1.5 million outstanding shares of Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. or ~8 percent of total shares outstanding. If the proposal were enacted, we would lose visibility on approximately virtually all of our shareholders that are also 13F filers or 100 percent, a significant loss of market transparency. We believe that this proposal would seriously jeopardize our shareholder engagement efforts by excluding more than 4,500 investment managers – or nearly 90% of all filers – from disclosure. While we welcome the Commission’s i nterest in modernizing 13F reporting, we believe that the proposed amendments would reduce transparency around hedge fund activism, significantly undermine issuer -investor engagement, and deprive retail investors of information they use to make investment decisions. We ask that the Commission withdraw this proposal and instead consider the common- sense reforms that were detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by NIRI, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq. Rather than allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, we ask the Commission to consider reducing the outdated 45-day reporting period, require 13F filers to disclose short positions, and support legislation to provide for monthly disclosure. It’s important to note th at without 13F data, issuers may not realize that activist funds are plotting a proxy contest until one of those funds triggers the 13D disclosure threshold and surfaces with a 5 percent (or more) position. The long -term impact on the public markets could be detrimental to the U.S., as this proposal will deter private companies from going public, or prompt them to list on overseas exchanges that provide greater transparency around reporting disclosures. We ask that the Commission steps back to reconsider the implications of this proposed rule, and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency. The need for effective shareholder engagement is clearer than ever, and this proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Sincerely, Richard Vincent CFO Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc."
"Julia Wright, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, ChampionX Corporation",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7653444-222372.htm,,"August 17, 2020 Contrary to both the original intent of Rule 13(f) and the current market use of 13(f) information, adoption of the SECs current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the companys institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis. This would be highly disadvantageous for small to mid cap companies in particular. The SECs proposal flies in the face of the transparency and engagement demanded by investors, asset managers and companies, including the 13(f) rulemaking petition filed in 2013 by NYSE Euronext, the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals and the National Investor Relations Institute, the 13(d) rulemaking petition that Wachtell filed in 2011, and many other calls for change in these reporting rules. The 13(f) petition sought a shortening of the 13(f) reporting deadline from 45 days to two business days after the relevant quarter, as well as monthly rather than quarterly reporting. As noted in the 13(f) petition, the 45-day reporting period—implemented over 35 years ago—was borne of practical considerations that are entirely antiquated in light of the increased sophistication of institutional investors and advances in information technology. The 13(d) rulemaking petition would require prompt disclosure of meaningful stakes, with timing windows and disclosure levels consistent with other major financial markets. Our company opposes adoption of the SECs proposal, and supports proposals that would increase transparency in shareholder ownership, including the long-pending 13(f) and 13(d) rulemaking petitions noted above.

Increasing the threshold to $3.5 billion AUM would greatly reduce information available to public company CFOs, who rely on reporting by smaller investment managers for shareholder communications and fundraising.

( NYSE : MSM) , a premier distributor of Metalworking and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (""MRO"") products and services to industrial customers throughout North America , headquartered in Melville, NY and Davidson, NC , I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and our investor base. The proposed rule, if enacted, w ould deprive us of timely information about inve stment funds that may make significant investments in our stock, impede our ability to attract new long - term investors, and impair engagement with shareholders about our long-term strategy and corporate governance . The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company , as well as for other U.S. public companies. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has ad equately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year . As a $3.8 billion market capitalization company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that th e proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion w ould allow 46% of our current 13F filers to avoid disclosure. While most of our largest investors would continue to disclose , many of those institutions are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each 2 quarter . For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable .1 The Commission ’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with th e recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID- 19 pandemic .2 Just as there is a need for transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, whe n market volatility is high and many investors have taken advantage of share price declines to amass larger stakes in potential target companies . Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, we would be unable to monitor those investors that would be exempt from reporting their positions, thus “gaming the system” and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit and not that of our company’s long- term shareholders. The loss of 13F data und er the proposed rule potentially expose s our company to short -term- oriented fund managers, who may demand that we slash jobs, reduce spending on equipment , increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in -line with our long -term strategy or th e investment strategy of our long -term investors. Also, w ithout the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if a fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is potentially planning a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. The loss of this essential 13F data would also impede our company’s ability to attract new long- term instit utional investors. Like many other mid -cap issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospect ive investors . Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, t he loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying our shares each quarter w ould hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and 1 According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold. See Jeremy Cohen and Jeff Zilka, Edelman, “SEC Proposed Rule Change Is A Step Backwards for Shareholder Demo cracy, ” July 29, 2020, available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec -proposed - rule-change-step -193708183.html . 2 As Chairman Jay Clayton and Corporation Fina nce Director William Hinman observed, “The SEC’s three-part mission -- maintain market integrity, facilitate capital formation , and protect investors -- takes on particular importance in times of economic uncertainty. Disclosure — providing the public with the information necessary to make informed investment decisions — is fundamental to furthering each aspect of our mission . . . .We urge companies to provide as much information as is practicable regarding their current financial and operating status, as well as their future operational and financial planning.” Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, ""The Importance of Disclosure – For Investors, Markets and Our Fight Against COVID-19,"" April 8, 2020. 3 raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, t he SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rule making . Our company also uses 13F data to a llocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one- on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors, shareholders who have increased their positions, and new investors , but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impact s of th is proposed 13F rulemaking on our company’s ability to monitor activists , attract new long -term investors, and engage effectively with our shareholders would far outweigh the modest cost savings for invest ment managers . The propo sed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not c onsistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other r ules, such as the Commission’s inflation -based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth co mpanies, 3 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,4 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.5 For the foregoing reasons, w e request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and i nstead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute , the NYSE Group , the Society for Corporate Governance , and Nasdaq .6 Rather than reduc e 13F transparency , we urge the SEC to promote more timely 3 Inflati on Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33- 10332; 34-80355; File No. S7 -09-16 (March 31, 2017). 4 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34 -88365; File No. S7 -06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million) . 5 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a -8, File No: S7 -23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increase the minimum holding requirement for shareholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mit igate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company’s shares for at least three years.) 6 See NYSE Group, NIRI, and Society for Corporate Governance , Request for R ulemakin g Concerning Amendment of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules Under Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in O rder to Shorten the R eporting Deadline under P aragraph (a)(1) of Rule 13f -1, Petition No. 4 -659, February 4, 2013, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4 -659.pdf ; NYSE Group and NIRI, Petition for Rulemaking Pursuant to Sections 10 and 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Petition No . 4-689, October 7, 2015, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2015/petn4 -689.pdf .; and Nasdaq, Petition for Rulemaking to Require Disclosure of Short Positions in Parity w ith Required Disclosure of Long Positions, Petition No. 4 -691, 4 and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period.

We believe that the SEC needs to take action to increase transparency and timeliness. Yet, the proposed rule flies in the face of the transparency and engagement demanded by investors, asset managers and companies and is completely contradictory to the aim of the 13(f) and 13(d) rules. Contrary to both the original intent of Rule 13(f) and the current market use of 13(f) information, adoption of the SEC’s current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the company’s institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis. In fact, by increasing the threshold to $3.5 billion, the number of reporting filers would be reduced by 90%. This would enable activist investors to “go dark” and make it significantly more difficult for issuers. In addition, we believe that given advances in technology, that the reporting timeline should be shorter not longer as proposed. The SEC should not have allowed common-sense improvement of the 13(f) and 13(d) regimes to languish unaddressed for nearly a decade. However, nor should it gut the reporting system by rendering it inapplicable to all but the largest reporting investors, reducing market transparency and burdening shareholder engagement.

Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effe ct for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13F’s requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers s uch as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? The goal of national and international standards bodies are to expand and adopt standards that are relevant and applicable to the industries that they serv e, in that vein FIX is in support of allowing ma nagers the ability to provide identifiers such as Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) as an alternative for the CUSIP number. Both the CUSIP and FIGI are important standards within the electronic trading industry and the FIX Protocol supports both the CUSIP and the FIGI. From the perspective of the FIX Trading Community the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) is complementary and broadly in use alongside the CUSIP system as are other proprietary identifiers, such as the SEDOL (London Stock Exchange Group), Valoren Number (SIX Group), RIC (Refin itiv (formerly Thomson -Reuters), and the ISIN (which can be contain a CUSIP, CINS (the international version of the CUSIP), SEDOL, or Valoren Number, along with others ). In this light, we believe that the FIGI should be considered for reporting as alterna tive additional identifier to the CUSIP. . The attraction of the FIGI to be added as an alternative / additional identifier is that it is a truly open and redistributable identifier, that also has the advantage of being unique by trading venue. The ability to redistribute the identifier promotes straight through processing, which likely will lead to more reliability and lower costs. The FIX Protocol , maintained by the FIX Trading Community. supports the following identifier sources and a structure to trans mit multiple identifiers ; the following is the current list of financial instrument identifiers supported by the FIX Protocol in the SecurityIDSource(22) Codeset that is used to identify the source of the SecurityID(48) field within FIX.

406 Research Economists,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-222300.pdf,,"We strongly recommend against increasing the filing threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion as the following three costs far outweigh the benefits. 1. 13(f) filings are widely used in academic research and have been essential to study questions related to market liquidity and transparency, the crowdedness of trades, the impact of global capital flows on US financial markets, and the measurement of systemic risks, among many other applications. These studies have been highly valuable to market participants and regulators. 2. Increasing the filing threshold will disadvantage smaller cap stocks because larger investors tend to invest in larger and more liquid securities. The liquidity and transparency of smaller cap stocks will suffer from a lower 13(f) coverage, which already receive less analyst coverage. In addition, research shows that smaller investors, as a group, have an outsized impact on stock prices and volatility. 3. Monitoring the ownership of ETFs and fixed income securities is valuable for assessing the efficacy and potential risk of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, such as the programs during the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. If anything, we would benefit from expanding the coverage of 13(f) filings to include fixed income securities and short positions. In terms of potential benefits to smaller asset m anagers, it is inconceivable that the costs of electronically submitting portfolio holdings once a quarter is substantial. The SEC should be concerned about lax accounting (or even fraud) if an asset manager argues that such information is difficult to produce and transmit. In summary, there are many costs to increasing the filing threshold and essentially no benefits. We attach a list of 406 research economists in support of this petition. Ralph S.J.

(NYSE:BERY), I am writing to express our opposition to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC” or “Commission”) proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We b elieve that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States . The proposed rule, if enacted, would impair engagement with shareholders and impede our ability to attract new long -term investors. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company . While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares each quarter. This information cannot be fully replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the C ommission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to our company and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors throughout the year . As a MID -cap company, we are particularly concerned about how th e reduction of 13F transparency w ould impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them . Our company uses 13F data to help allocate the limited time of our seni or executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one -on- one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. 101 Oakley Street Evansville, IN 47710 USA www.b erryglobal.com The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long -term institutional investors.

"LTC. Andre A. Authier, US Army",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7640368-222291.htm,,"August 13, 2020 Members of the SEC, I understand you are considering raising the threshold for 13F reporting from $100M to $3.5B. I believe this is not in the best interest of the SEC or individual stockholders. My understanding is that this will effectively reduce 13F submissions by about 90% - how does this fit with making the SEC and investing activity more transparent when suddenly 90% of the visible activity would be hidden if this is passed? As an individual investor, I rely mostly on some investment advisory services to analyze stocks and make recommendations, but review their research myself to better understand how the process works. By removing 90% of these large market movers it will negatively affect my investment decisions and that of a host of other smaller individual investors trying to make wise choices in a sometimes chaotic market. I also understand that the 90% of the market movers that would be removed from the 13F filing requirement have access to company managers and would be able to obtain information that us smaller investors would not have. To do this at a time when many are protesting over the have elites verses the no have little guys would seem to me like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. You would only make things worse by doing so. The purpose of government is to help keep the process honest and transparent to the maximum extent possible. This rule change would do the opposite of that. Once faith is lost in an institution, it is extremely difficult to gain it back. I therefore urge you to drop this consideration for if nothing else maintaining the integrity of the SEC as a fair arbiter of the market and its participants – regardless of the wealth level. Thank you for your consideration of my opinion on the matter."

Kraus, Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate, DIRTT Environmental Solutions",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7640400-222310.pdf,,"August 12, 2020 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of DIRTT Environmental Solutions, an interior construction company that uses proprietary software to design and manufacture fully customizable environments, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would significantly impair engagement with our institutional investors about our business strategy and corporate governance, reduce our ability to attract new investors, deprive us of timely information about activist funds that take significant positions in our stock, and exacerbate short-term pressures on our company at the expense of long-term shareholder value. While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the Commission’s arbitrary 35-times increase in the 13F threshold is not justified by the modest cost savings for investors. The 13F proposal is entirely inconsistent with the measured approach the SEC has applied to economic thresholds in other recent rulemakings, such as the Commission’s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,1 the adjustments to the transition thresholds for 1 Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments Under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release Nos. 33-10332; 34-80355; File No. S7-09-16 (March 31, 2017). 2 companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,2 and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.3 We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal on public companies and their obligation to confer regularly with their investors. As a sub US$150 million market cap company, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our ability to identify our most active shareholders and engage effectively with them. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow 6 of our top 12 investors, representing approximately 30% of our outstanding shares, to evade disclosure. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the $3.5 billion threshold that is far more valuable. While 13F data is not as timely it could be, it is only data available to us that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts and represent a meaningful incremental cost to emerging growth companies. The loss of this essential 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new investors. Like many other small-cap issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business. The loss of transparency around who is buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the negative impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Our company also uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our CEO, so we try to give priority to our largest investors, shareholders who have increased their positions, fund managers with a track record of activism, and new investors. As a company in the midst of a strategic transformation to position for long term growth, the loss of 13F data will also expose us to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we slash jobs, reduce research spending, 2 Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer Definitions, Release No. 34-88365; File No. S7-06-19 (March 12, 2020) (the SEC increased the threshold for exiting accelerated filer status by 20 percent from $50 million to $60 million, while the threshold for exiting large accelerated filer status increased by 12 percent from $500 million to $560 million). 3 Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, File No: S7-23-19 (Nov. 5, 2019) (The Commission proposed to increase the minimum economic threshold for shareholder resolutions from $2,000 to $25,000, but would mitigate the impact of that change on small investors by allowing them to use the $2,000 threshold if they continuously hold a company’s shares for at least three years.) 3 increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long-term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly distraction, so many public companies (especially small and mid-cap issuers) often conclude that they have no choice but to settle with short-term activists. Market observers expect another surge in proxy fights after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors. Without the 13F data we receive now, our company will not know if a pack of activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 billion threshold) are plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. Having been involved with a US based activist fund in 2018, prior to becoming an SEC registrant, visibility into their ownership and opportunity for engagement could have made a meaningful difference in the substantial time and financial resources invested in arriving at a resolution. For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw these proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the common-sense reforms detailed in rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.4 Rather than reduce market transparency, we urge the SEC to modernize 13F by cutting the archaic 45-day reporting period, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and supporting monthly disclosure by 13F filers.

Marilyn Reiter,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7640396-222303.htm,,"August 12, 2020 the proposed change to increase the 13F requirements for hedge funds from $100M to 3.5B is a crazy increase. It shows the leverage that the hedge funds have on the SEC and how they want to keep all the money transactions private. For a retail investor we have neither the funds or influence to swing stock prices the way the hedge funds companies do. It is useful for me to know what they are invested in so I can understand who the large influencers are on a company. I understand that this requirement has not been adjusted since 1975 so increasing it some is reasonable. I would like to know why this doesnt follow an increase with inflation? The most that would make sense is $400M. It seems like this change in the rule is to once again, accommodate the big time hedge fund operator and mow over the small retail investor. I try to see what the bigger funds are doing to see what they are trying to influence. They have more of the inside track on what is happening in the big picture. Just the other day I almost sold out of my Disney stock when I saw there was a big time buy by a hedge fund operator that disclosed their buy via their 13F. I stayed in and am happy I did Please review this proposed change again, the increase proposed is absurd."

(NYSE: NP), a small cap manufacturing company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. We believe that the SEC’s proposal would result in a significant loss of market transparency to our company and other public traded companies in the United States. The proposed rule would impair our ability to understand our shareholder base and engage with them, impede our ability to attract new long-term investors, and deprive us of information about potential activist actions in a timely manner. The 13F filings are the only accurate source of ownership information available to our company as well as other U.S. issuers. While 13F data is not as timely as it could be, it is the only data that we have that shows which “street name” investors are buying or selling our shares. This information cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves often rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point or anchor point for their research efforts. We do not believe that the Commission has adequately considered the potential impact of this 13F proposal to companies like ours and our obligation to regularly confer with our investors. As a company with sales and market capitalization below one billion dollars, we are particularly concerned about how the reduction of 13F transparency would impair our abilities. We estimate that the proposed increase in the 13F threshold to $3.5 billion would allow at least a quarter of our current 13F filers to avoid disclosure, many of which are active and thoughtful investors, with whom we highly value interactions. While some of our largest investors would continue to disclose shares held, many of those are passive, indexed holders with positions that do not change appreciably each quarter. For our company and many others, it is the 13F data from the active investment managers and hedge funds under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold that is more valuable.[1] Reduced Engagement Due to Lack of Transparency Our company uses 13F data to allocate the limited time of our senior executives among the many requests that we receive from investors for one-on-one calls or meetings. We cannot possibly say yes to every investor request to speak with our senior management, so we try to give priority to not only our largest investors and fund managers, but also those shareholders with smaller positions who are interested in increasing their holdings in our company. With the proposed increase in the 13F threshold, we would not have visibility into this important group. Negative Impact on Capital Formation The loss of 13F data also would impede our company’s ability to attract new long-term institutional investors. Like many other issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow our business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding, as well as buying or selling our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. Increased Risk of Activism The Commission’s proposal to significantly reduce 13F disclosures also is at odds with recent requests by the SEC that we and other public companies “provide as much information as is practicable” to investors amid the market uncertainty caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.[2] Just as there is a need for greater transparency on our part to our investors, our need for ownership data is even greater during these uncertain times, when market volatility is high. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule potentially exposes our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may take measures that may not be part of our long-term strategy or the investment strategy of our long-term investors. Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors.[3] While we agree that SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our company’s ability to engage effectively with our shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,[4] the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,[5] and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.[6] For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission withdraw its proposed 13F amendments and instead pursue the reforms detailed in the rulemaking petitions submitted by National Investor Relations Institute, the NYSE Group, the Society for Corporate Governance, and Nasdaq.[7] Rather than reduce 13F transparency, we urge the SEC to promote more timely and complete disclosure by supporting monthly reporting, requiring the public disclosure of short positions, and cutting the 45-day reporting period. Sincerely, Paul DeSantis Chief Financial Officer [1] According to Edelman’s financial communications practice group, 60 percent of activist asset managers would fall under the $3.5 billion threshold.

Raising the reporting threshold is an unnecessary reduction in transparency without benefit to investors or capital markets. By the SEC's own admission, the rule change would eliminate the vast majority of filings, implying the rule is meant to benefit filers at the expense of non-institutional investors. 13-F filings contain valuable information for investor research and their availability on the SEC's website serves a public good of verification to materials provided by the institutions. Removing these filings is patently inconsistent with promoting transparency. Additionally, the rationales for the proposed rule change are unconvincing. Namely, the true compliance burden this causes to managers and the mere possibility of front running are dubious given the 45-day delay that which filing is required and disclosed."

Below are some comments: a) The time required and associated cost to file this form is trivial to managers. All they need to do is consolidate their brokerage statements and submit the form. They already do need to consolidate this information to update their clients quarterly and the additional work to file the form is close to zero. b) The 13F filing threshold was not modified in 45 years. So, one has to wonder why there is now a proposal for the increase from $100M to a whopping $3.5B in one step. Who is to benefit from doing this? As the regulatory requirements are minimal for hedge funds, an argument can be made that the threshold should be lowered so that this minimal regulation applies to more managers. c) As part of the 13F regulation is aimed at protecting the American public from risks associated with hedge funds, any modification in the filing threshold should be done in conjunction with several other minimums associated with the 1933, 1934, and 1940 Securities and Investment Company Registration Acts. For example, if the threshold is to be increased 35-times from $100M to $3.5B, the ""accredited investor"" minimum should also be increased from $1M to $35M."

"Darrell Heaps, Founder and CEO, Q4 Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7570087-222220.pdf,,"HeadquartersUS Operations 469A King St. W.135 E. 57th Street Toronto, ON Suite 07A115 M5V 1K4New York, NY, 10022 August 10, 2020 Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 rule-comments@sec.gov Re:ReportingThresholdforInstitutionalInvestmentManagers,ReleaseNo.34-89290;File No. S7-08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of Q4 Inc, a provider of technology and market intelligence services to the investor relations community headquartered in Toronto with offices in New York City and London, I am writing to express our opposition to the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Form 13F reporting rules for institutional investment managers. Q4 is a technology leader servicing more than 2,000 U.S.-listed public companies representing almost $18 trillion of market value. In addition to a comprehensive technology platform that includes website hosting and analytics, IR-related events hosting (such as quarterly earnings) through conference calls, webcasting and video, and a capital markets database/Customer Relationship Management application, Q4 also provides a best-in-class equity surveillance service that allows clients to understand who may be buying and/or selling their stock, and what may be driving price movement. Our key relationships reside with both Investor Relations and Chief Financial Officers of each corporate issuer, providing us a valuable perspective on this proposal. Based on extensive analysis and discussions with many of the most well-known companies in the world, we strongly believe that the proposed amendment would reduce transparency around holdings, increase the risk of activism, undermine issuer-investor engagement, and negatively impact our customer’s ability to effectively identify attractive potential investors. Reduced Transparency Based on our analysis as of July 27, 2020, all Q4 clients receiving our equity surveillance services would be impacted by this proposal. The average percentage of outstanding shares that would be affected is 12%, with a maximum of 52%. For those at the upper end of this range, it effectively removes the issuer’s ability to identify and confirm ownership of more than half of their P (416) 626-7829 TF (877) 426-7829Q4INC.COM HeadquartersUS Operations 469A King St. W.135 E. 57th Street Toronto, ON Suite 07A115 M5V 1K4New York, NY, 10022 shareholders. We consider this significant loss of visibility as a material step backwards in market transparency, an initiative explicitly mentioned in the Dodd-Frank Act, and one the SEC has historically sought​[1]​ . This rulemaking would exempt 4,500 (89 percent of current 13F filers) from disclosure, including many hedge funds and active money managers who would fall under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold. In today’s market where many of the largest shareholder positions are held by passive ETF managers, a reduction in visibility of active investment management is not in anyone’s best interest. Increased Risk of Activism During these uncertain times, the need for ownership data is substantially increased. Today’s volatile markets present opportunities to activists to build sizable positions when share prices decline precipitously. Under the proposed $3.5 billion threshold, our clients would be unable to monitor activists who would be exempt from reporting their positions, potentially “gaming the system” through use of complex derivative instruments and using the increased lack of transparency for their benefit. This is counter to the long-term timeline that companies invest by, and that which shareholders measure value creation. The loss of 13F data under the proposed rule also exposes companies to the risk that short-term-oriented fund managers may demand that issuers eliminate jobs, reduce research funding, cut investment in infrastructure, or take other measures that may not be part of the issuer’s long-term strategy or the investment strategy of well-aligned, long-term investors. According to Activist Insight, 2019 was a record year for activism as 470 U.S. companies were targeted and 95 proxy contests were launched.​[2]​ Many corporate advisers are warning companies to prepare for another surge in activism in 2021-22 after the pandemic subsides (as there was after the financial crisis of 2008-09), so the timing of the SEC’s proposed reduction of 13F transparency would be especially unfortunate for companies and long-term investors.​[3] Without the 13F data we receive now, we will be unable to alert our clients if an activist fund manager that falls under the $3.5 billion threshold is plotting a proxy contest until 10 days after the fund crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. This is particularly concerning and may lead to costly and distracting proxy battles rather than cultivating an open dialog between management and interested parties. Shareholder Engagement We also believe that this proposal would seriously jeopardize a corporate issuer’s ability to effectively allocate the company’s most precious resource - executive time. Q4 assists its customers in determining how to best allocate management’s time to the investment community. 13F data is instrumental in these decisions concerning which bank conferences, one-on-one calls or meetings to P (416) 626-7829 TF (877) 426-7829Q4INC.COM HeadquartersUS Operations 469A King St. W.135 E. 57th Street Toronto, ON Suite 07A115 M5V 1K4New York, NY, 10022 participate in. Since executive time is a finite resource, issuers must give priority to not only large holders, but smaller shareholders who may increase their positions in the future. Again, ​more than 5,000 investment managers – or nearly 90% of all filers – would be exempt from this important reporting mechanism. ​With this proposed increase in the 13F threshold, companies would lose visibility into this important group, thereby harming a small investor’s ability to access corporate management teams. Shareholder Identification Finally, identification of, and engagement with, potential investors would be severely restricted with this proposal. No longer would an issuer be able to understand the trends and themes that a smaller fund or firm may focus on. No longer would an issuer be able to identify investment managers who are allocating capital to the space where they reside. In short. the loss of 13F data for investment firms would impede our client’s ability to identify and attract new long-term institutional investors. Like most issuers and service providers, Q4 uses 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of outreach efforts to prospective investors. Both of these practices are essential for our clients to effectively access the capital markets and to grow their business. Under the proposed threshold, the loss of transparency around who is holding as well as buying their shares each quarter would hinder their ability to compete for and raise growth capital. As required by the agency’s mission, the SEC should fully consider the impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. While we agree that the SEC should modernize its ownership disclosure rules, we believe that the negative impacts of this 13F proposal on our customer’s ability to engage effectively with their shareholders, attract new long-term investors, and detect potential activists would far outweigh the modest cost savings for investment managers. The proposed 35-fold increase in the 13F threshold is not consistent with the incremental approach the SEC has taken when adjusting economic thresholds in other rules, such as the Commission’s inflation-based increase in the gross revenue cap for emerging growth companies,​[4]​ the adjustments to the transition thresholds for companies that exit accelerated filer status and large accelerated filer status,​[5]​ and the proposed updates to SEC’s rules on shareholder resolutions.​[6] ​Adjusted for inflation, the value of the US dollar has quintupled. Perhaps consider applying the same math to this threshold. In closing, we ask that the Commission reconsiders the proposed rule, and instead refocus its efforts on the modernization of the 13F disclosure regime to improve transparency. Those efforts could include shortening the reporting delay from 45 days currently, increasing the frequency to monthly, and/or including both long and short positions. Any of these would align well with your stated goal of increasing market transparency. The importance of effective shareholder identification and P (416) 626-7829 TF (877) 426-7829Q4INC.COM HeadquartersUS Operations 469A King St. W.135 E. 57th Street Toronto, ON Suite 07A115 M5V 1K4New York, NY, 10022 engagement is more important than ever, and this proposal would be a tremendous misstep at a time when shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency. As such, we urge the Commission to withdraw this proposal. Sincerely, Darrell Heaps Founder and CEO Q4 Inc.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549-1090 Re: Comments on Proposed Rule on Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers. Release No. 34-89290; File No. S7-08-20; RIN 3235-AM65 Dear Ms. Countryman, We respectfully submit this letter in response to the solicitation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for comments on the proposed rule for updating the reporting threshold for Form 13F reports by institutional investment managers. The Commission is proposing to raise the threshold from $100 million to $3.5 billion, effectively exempting the vast bulk of current reporting filers. The motivation for the amendment reflects a desire to eliminate both the compliance and the indirect costs for the “smaller” investment managers, and the proposed new threshold is set to capture the change in size and structure of the U.S. securities market since 1975, when the disclosure rule was introduced. We believe that the analysis that leads to this proposal is fundamentally misleading and omits key effects of the visibility of institutional investment managers. Some of these effects are not directly related to the increased size of the U.S. securities market, but rather reflect aspects of the governance mechanisms of U.S. corporations. We highlight important weaknesses of the current analysis and outline missing factors that ought to be considered. 1. A key motivation for the amendment is to save the compliance costs of the smaller investment managers. We believe, like other academics and market observers, that the SEC overestimates these costs. Most importantly, even if the estimates were accurate, compliance costs would still be nearly trivial in relation to the economic impact of market participants losing visibility over $2.3 trillion assets. Compliance costs therefore ought to play a minor role on the design of a new threshold. 2. An amendment to the current threshold should follow form a cost-benefit analysis of the effects of altering the visibility of the portfolios of investment managers. The Commission argues that increasing the threshold would save front-running and copycatting costs for smaller managers, which could trade profitably on their private information. This is a sensitive insight, although arguably incomplete. 3. The gross benefits of preventing front-running and copycatting can be measured by the value of the information that investment managers may generate once they can internalize the profits of trading on it. However, the associated market opacity comes at a cost. Other less informed investors, typically small and dispersed, know that they will be potentially trading against better informed investment managers which they are no longer able to track. This lack of visibility therefore reduces the profitability of their investment, their incentives to invest, and ultimately the formation of capital. 4. The visibility of investment managers’ positions is particularly relevant for activist hedge funds and their target companies. The increased size of some U.S. corporations and the sophistication of activist campaigns has led many activists to never cross the 5% 13D disclosure threshold. Consequently, many companies only know of the positions of activist funds before their campaigns because of the 13F fillings. Raising the disclosure threshold to $3.5 billion would enable most activists to conceal their positions further, thus making bigger profits and ultimately engaging in more campaigns. 5. Activist funds serve an important disciplining role and, on average, improve the value of their target companies. While an increase in hedge fund activist campaigns might therefore be desirable, the potential benefits nonetheless ought to be weighed against the costs of the market opacity that enables them, i.e., of the loss of visibility of informed investors and the potential reduction in capital formation by less informed investors (point 3). 6. The above suggests that the optimal threshold should balance the marginal benefits of reduced disclosure (higher threshold) in terms of managerial disciplining induced by greater hedge fund activism, against the marginal costs in terms of reduced capital formation by less informed investors. 7. Determining the optimal threshold is complicated, and optimal policy is necessarily nuanced. However, we believe that a 35-fold increase in the reporting threshold may increase the profits of activist funds far more than necessary to provide incentives to perform their monitoring role. The benefits of the new threshold would therefore be outweighed by the cost of other investors being discouraged from taking positions because they are at an informational disadvantage, depressing equity prices, and potentially impairing the ability of companies to raise capital.

Today an IPO came out BIGC that i could not participate in - all of the shares went to institutions. I can not get research reports from most if not all brokerage firms that institutions can obtain as I obviously can not provide the commissions necessary to pay. There was a virtual stock conference several months that many companies participated in, I also could not listen in to this conference. It seems the plan is - all of us have to hire professional people at 100 BP fees to manage our money. I think this is the wrong approach by the SEC. This rule is just again limits the information individual investors can see. I suppose an institution that manages $2B charging 1% (means its making $30M/yr) needs to have its costs reduced just a bit at the expense of retired investors like self. The SEC should try to empower individual investors I believe."

Congress passed the 13-f rule to better maintain a fair market for all investors. By raising the limits on this rule from $100M to $3.5B, you are defeating the purpose of the rule, and you are giving yet another huge edge to investment managers over the small retail investors. The costs for these money managers to file these reports are minuscule compared to the amount of money they are managing--they do not need relief--this is not a burden to them. Large money managers already have a huge advantage over small investors, and this will hurt market transparency. This will just create more wealth inequality in our society allowing the rich to get richer. Given this limit was instituted over 40 years ago, however, I would be in support of a more modest increase in line with the rise in inflation over this period, to $400M. At the same time, I would suggest you reduce the window for filing these reports from 45 days to 30 days, and change the frequency to a monthly basis vs. a quarterly basis. Given all the advances in computer technology over the last 40+ years, these money managers should be able to provide more timely reports to the public and at a much lower cost than they were 40+ years ago."

While I can understand the justification for proportionally raising the threshold to an equivalent $100MM from the decade which the rule was enacted, I believe that $3.5B is too high and an obscure threshold. I would recommend changing the filing requirement to a flat $1B. It is a round number that even with market fluctuation you have a generally good idea if you are at or above that threshold whereas $3.5B is harder to have an idea about. I am responsible for gathering all the data for my firms 13f filings and I can tell you that it is not as easy as clicking a button as most people think. If I had to put an conservative estimate on the time it takes to gather the information, pull out pertain data and then compare to the SECs 13f report (which does not help that it is in PDF form and cannot be export to excel), I would say I am looking at 3 to 4 hours a quarter doing this. That may not sound like a lot to a retail investor or anybody not in the business, but those are hours that cannot be gained back. In summary I support the purposed rule change albeit not to $3.5B but a smaller, rounder threshold such as $1B. There are other ways for people to gather information about who is holding a 13f eligible security, especially if that firm is a larger institution. The $100 MM is an operational burden for smaller to mid-sized firms to have to spend precious hours every quarter data gathering and filing. The change to a higher dollar will not drastically change the transparency of larger institutions who have to file but will give much needed time back to small and mid-sized firms who would now fall below the threshold. These are my opinions and do not represent the views of my employer(s), client(s), or other institutions."

However, from management and an issuers perspective, this would eliminate an important accountability on investors. As manager of a well performing bank with a thinly traded stock, we have to make decisions for the good of shareholders and customers over the long term that could be easily influenced by investors with individual motivations due to our lack of liquidity and large base of retail investors. Knowing our institutional investors and keeping them in the loop as we pursue and update strategy is critical to our shareholder relations program. The vast majority, if not all, of our current institutional investors find this relationship helpful. Perhaps an increase to the current $100 million limit is appropriate due the passage of time, but please continue reporting requirements so that the majority of Form 13F reporters today continue to have this accountability and relationship with small company issuers in the future.

The SEC is supposed to promote transparency and level the playing field. This rule is disadvantageous to the average investor in the following ways: Not being able to identify over-owned/crowded stocks.This proposal will limit future academic research for instance top 100 most popular stocks, top exits from manager portfolios over specified periods. While the rule will remove the burdens of compliance on the smaller managers, this concern of the SEC is overstated. Managers know at the push of a button what they are invested in. It is just one extra report per quarter and most managers do provide monthly or quarterly risk reporting to their investors. Therefore, concerns of administrative burdens to the smaller manager are overstated. Should there be another significant market correction, this will reduce the proposed number of reporting managers (now down from 5,000+ to 500 if this rule goes into effect). As has been said in nearly all comments, for any investor, since when is less transparency a good thing? There should be more transparency during these uncertain times, and increased 13F reporting frequency. Furthermore, long, short and derivative positions should be included. The pros of 13F reporting is that the investor can track if a manager is doing what they say on the prospectus e.g. if a small cap manager has a portfolio of large cap holdings, then that would be questionable to the investor. This rule takes that check away. The proposal may affect the attraction of foreign capital to the U.S. The lack of transparency and level playing field may make potential investors wary of proper regulation within the capital markets. While the proposed rule intends to stifle copycatting or front-running of smaller investment managers' portfolios, it will also increase chances of pump-and-dump among those managers that do not meet the reporting threshold, driving the prices of securities up. It limits the data evaluation (and resources available) of the health of a company the retail investor looks at.

Acme United is traded on the NYSE American Exchange, symbol ACU. We are one of the largest suppliers of scissors, first aid kits, and safety items in the U.S. with sales of approximately $150 million. Our market capitalization is about $75 million. Most of our shareholders are retail investors and small institutions. Although we aspire for our stock to be owned by larger institutions, we do not at present have the market capitalization, liquidity, or independent research to attract them. We believe that the SEC's proposal, which would allow 89 percent of current 13F filers to go dark, would significantly impair engagement with our retail and institutional investors about our business strategy and corporate governance, reduce our ability to attract new investors, deprive us of timely information about activist funds that take significant positions in our stock, and exacerbate short-term pressures on our company at the expense of long-term shareholder value. As a small listed company, the current l 3F filings of small institutions, family offices, and retail investors generate visibility of our shareholders. The proposed rule change would erase such visibility because most of our shareholders do not meet the proposed asset management threshold. Our largest institutional investor is The Capital Management Corporation, based in Richmond, VA, which holds 12.15% of our company but would not be required to report. Similarly, our second largest institutional investor is N011h Star Investment Management based in Chicago, IL owning 12.04% of our outstanding shares; it too would be exempt from reporting. The third and fourth largest shareholders would report under the proposed change: Renaissance Technologies holds 5.48% of the company and Dimensional Fund Advisers owns 4.92% but neither communicates with the company. The fifth largest shareholder is Bard Associates in Chicago, IL which holds of 3 .93%. Bard Associates would not meet the proposed threshold for l 3F filings. The proposed rule change would harm our shareholders and our company by creating a lack of the ability to know our key shareholders and to communicate with them. 55 Walls Drive• Fairfield, CT 06824 • Ph6ne: (203) 254-6060 • Fax: (203) 254-6019 Visit us at www.acmeunited.com While 13F data is not as timely it could be, it is only data that U.S. companies have that shows which ""street name"" investors are buying or selling their shares each quarter. This data cannot be replaced by hiring stock surveillance firms, which themselves rely on quarterly 13F data as a starting point for their research efforts. The loss of this essential 13F data would impede our company's ability to attract new investors. Like many issuers, we use 13F filings to identify potential shareholders (such as those who have invested in similar companies) and to measure the effectiveness of our outreach efforts to prospective investors. These practices are essential for a company to effectively access the capital markets and to grow its business. The loss of transparency around who is buying our shares each quarter would hinder the ability of our company to continue to raise growth capital. As required by the agency's mission, the SEC should fully consider the negative impact on capital formation before proceeding with this rulemaking. The loss of 13F data would also expose our company to a greater risk of ambush activism by short-term-oriented fund managers, who may demand that we slash jobs, reduce research spending, increase share buybacks, or take other measures that may not be in the interest of our long-term investors. Proxy contests can be a costly distraction, so many public companies ( especially small and mid-cap issuers) often conclude that they have no choice but to settle with short-term activists. Without the l 3F data we receive now, our company will not know if a pack of activist fund managers (who fall under the $3.5 billion threshold) are plotting a proxy contest until IO days after one of those funds crosses the 13D disclosure threshold and publicly surfaces with a 5 percent (or often more) position. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission should withdraw the proposed 13F amendments. s;J;c.J.o WalterC.J~ Chairman and CEO 2 .~.---~---------- ------------ -:.\ ♦ J--• ... • .. ,•,:,•\."

On the 16th March ESMA lowered its notification threshold for short selling from 0.2% to 0.1%. Shortly thereafter the Italian Regulator CONSOB, lowered the minimum disclosure threshold from 5% to 3% of total shares for SMEs and from 3% to 1% for large companies. As to the point from your proposal:""We believe that increasing the reporting threshold would provide meaningful regulatory relief for smaller managers ... in terms of a reduction in direct compliance costs and indirect costs"" Technology has come a long way since 1975 and there are now off-the-shelf solutions available which support the automated creation and filing of the 13F report in a few mouse clicks. So to suggest that saving a few hours a year would be ""meaningful"" when combined with the detrimental loss of transparency is spurious at best.

Knowing if institutions are collectively buying or selling certain stocks is important information – and its also useful information for companies to know who their shareholders are as well. The strange thing is that the SEC claims it wants to increase transparency in the market, yet this rule will do exactly the opposite It will hide the transactions and holdings of all but the very largest of institutions, keeping average investors in the dark about what the smart money is buying and selling. Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SECs emphasis on a level fair playing field, for the average investor, this rule change makes no sense at all.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 -1090 VIA EMAIL RE: Proposal to Raise 13F Filing Threshold , File No. S7 -08-20 Dear Ms. Countryman , We’re offering comments opposing the proposed plan by the Commission’s division of Investment Management to raise the asset -threshold to $3.5 billion and exempt over 4,500 current reporting firms, over 89% of total current filers. ModernIR is the leader in quantitative equity -market analytics for US -listed companies, serving trillions of dollars of total market -capitalization as the investor -relations profession’s market - structure experts . We have a well -informed perspective on US equity capital markets. Our written testimony on recommended improvements to capital -formation for issuers was entered into the permanent Congressional record at a June 2017 session of the House Financial Services Committee. I was first struck, reading the proposal, that there is no proffered justification save a reduction in work for the SEC, which is not a purpose supported by the Securities Act (“the Act”) , and a minor diminution in administrative costs for fund s the amount of which is immaterial for registered advisors of all sizes, which is likewise not a purpose supported by the Act. The Act is meant to foster free and fair markets for all constituents. The Commission outlined 34 questions for commenters. N ot one pertains to issuers. The Act specifically prohibits discriminating against issuers, by name. Moving to core substance, t here are four failures in this proposal, which might be mitigated through concessions or revisions . I’ll address each: 1. The Commission’s misconstruction of the purpose for the 13 (f) Amendments. 2. The subjectivity of revisions focused only on the financial threshold. 8/3/2020 2 3. Transparency for issuers. 4. Transparency for retail investors. The proposal contends that the “ Legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed so that reporting would cover a large proportion of managed assets, while minimizing the number of reporting persons.” It’s a subjective statemen t. I suspect the SEC is trying to argue that because most investors were individuals at the time, and big asset managers were few in number, that the legislative aim was to cover the few rather than the many. In fact, the legislative history is clear: The Securities Act and the Exchange Act, take n together , were intended to protect investors and to outlaw fraud. The results of the study Congress commissioned from the SEC and which the SEC cites concluded: “The past and likely future growth of institutional investors in the equity markets, makes th e collection of timely information about institutional holdings and activity in securities essential for an agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws . . .The importance of a regularized, uniform, and comprehensive scheme of institutional reporting cannot be minimized in light of the demonstrated growth of institutional investment and its impact on the structure of the securities markets, corporate issuers and individual investors.” i The words that stand out to me are “comprehensive” and “timely ,” along with that last sentence highlighting how the expected growth of institutional investment would impact market structure, corporate issuers and individual investors. And I think we can agree, backing up, that c omprehensi ve means “as complete as possible.” If the SEC exempts 4,500 investors from disclosures, it’s not a comprehensive standard, even if the remaining 550 investors required to file disclosures hold 90% of assets. Which brings us to Point #2: The Subjectivi ty of Revisions Focused Only on the Financial Threshold. The Commission claims in its proposal that (bolded emphasis ours) “Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission broad rulemaking authority to determine the size of the institutions required to file reports, the format and frequency of the reporting requirements, and the information to be disclosed in each report.”ii So, why did the Commission choose only the size of the institutions required to file and the format (XML), while omitting any co nsideration of updated frequency (or disclosed information, for that matter, such as short -selling positions mandated by Dodd -Frank legislationiii)? After all, in 1975 when Congress passed the the 13(f) amendments , the timely filing mechanism was the US mail. And the standard was four times per year. 8/3/2020 3 Now in the equity markets, the standard means of communication is instant messaging . Online retail brokerage firm Robinhood with 13 million users posts the number o f accounts holding stocks by ticker via a real-time , free, public API. Should a retail broker -dealer be more transparent than hedge funds? It’s a matter for debate and lawsuits. But the point is, the way we gather and disseminate information has changed dramatically since 1975, and the SEC’s proposal here is dead silent on frequency though the Commission claims oversight of timing. If the SEC wants to change financial thresholds, it should also change timeframes, and arguably, methods of dissemination, a nd content too, to reflect the way markets work and information flows now. The issuer community led by NIRI, the investor relations professional association (on whose board I currently sit) , has been trying for decades altogether in one way or another to speed up reporting timeframes. In 2011, my firm led an effort, the Issuer Data Initiativeiv, to move reporting to monthly, and to include both long and short holdings . The 2010 Dodd -Frank bill passed by Congress includes a proviso directing the Commission to study and implement some form of short -reporting. There are legislative efforts underway to shorten timeframes for the related 13D and 13G forms for large holdings. On all thes e, there has been no regulatory action. Why omit timeframes now? Transpar ency for Issuers. In February 2015, I wrote an editorial for Traders Magazinev referencing a speech by then -SEC chair Mary Jo White, in which she said, paraphrasing, that we must evaluate all (regulatory) issues through the prism of the best interest of investors and the facilitation of capital formation for public companies. The se condary markets exist for investors and public companies, and their interests must be paramount. Perhaps Chair Clayton feels differently about the capital markets, but I doubt it. So, while this proposal narrowly fragments investors into camps – Filers an d Non -Filers – it does not serve their uniform interests and it prejudices both the tens of millions of retail investors and the thousands of US -listed issuers relying on 13Fs for vital information on who owns what . The Commission’s responsibility is to provide a level playing field for all, without jeopardizing any constituency’s interests. Sure, it’s a tough job balancing competing aims . Exchanges must do it, serving customers with sometimes opposing objectives (the Exchange Act bars them from discrimin ating against any constituency, and Reg NMS’s Access Rule requires fairness for allvi). Public companies must do it, serving an array of self -interested stakeholders besides shareholders. And yet somehow, it works. By our estimates, public companies spen d roughly $5 billion per year on legislatively enforced and SEC- mandated disclosures for investors. Ironically, most assets are now managed by behemoth firms following models that largely disregard issuer disclosures. This, by the way, is the group you capture with your new thresholds – the ones whose behavior is disconnected from the messages and disclosures companies expend vast resources supporting. 8/3/2020 4 It’s probable that a disproportionate share of the nine percent of assets and 4,500 firms exempted under this proposal are “Active” stock -picking investors, the ones public companies most need to understand and track. These are the ones to which my profession, investor relations, seeks to communicate differentiating me ssages about story, management, strategy, financials. Se t this new threshold, and you deprive public companies of capacity to tie outreach to investor- response , and you obviate the feedback mechanism for those billions of dollars spent on investor -disclosu res. To put a fine point on it, a t leviathans Blackrock , Vanguard, State Street and Fidelity, the preponderance of assets are now passive. And remember, Exchange Traded Funds, investment phenomenon of the modern era, are created and redeemed off -market i n large blocks between sponsors and A uthorized Participants, transactions measuring in the trillions of dollars per year, which are not counted as fund -turnover or portfolio -changes. Remove transparency into ownership and investor -targeting , and there’s yet another reason for companies to choose private equity for growth over public markets. And without public companies, there is no market. Last, we come to: Transparency for Retail Investors . Protecting Main Street investors is a critical Commission responsibility under The Securities Act. The scores of millions making their own buying and selling choices deserve the best information available to support prudent decision -making. Many rely on seeing what the professional investor buy s or sell s. They learn by observing. Eliminat ing thousands of investors from this educational bastion because some of them don’t want to be observed is an unnecessary and inexcusable introduction of risk into retail investment. Now, having presented what we think is strong rebuttal to the proposal, we can always compromise and find a way that works for everyone. To that end, we offer these thoughts. Points for Compromise If the Commission is dead set on changing thresholds – half the questions posed in the proposal relate to what should shape the correct threshold – then negotiate with issuers and accommodate their legitimate right to fair and equal treatment and transpare ncy. 1. Make the filings monthly and long and short, since timely information is an objective of the legislation and a responsibility under the purview of the SEC . There’s no logical basis for lifting the threshold to modernize the filings without moderniz ing timeframes too. 2. Predicate the threshold not on the stock market’s appreciation but on inflation -adjusted assets. The US dollar is worth about 20% of what it was in 1975 when Congress added the 13(f) amendments. So set the threshold at $500 million. 3. Adopt the Australian standard vii: Give public companies authority to request from any investor regulated by t he Act a timely and confidential disclosure of all economic interest the investor holds in the issuer’s shares. This standard preserves confidentia lity for investors 8/3/2020 5 while permitting public companies to know their holders, a baseline expectation for any public company. In sum , it would do grave disservice to US capital markets a nd its vital issuer and retail- investor constituents if the SEC were to take a long step backward in transparency. Nobody wins here but a handful of secretive hedge funds. That’s not a level playing field, nor a free and fair market. But we can compromis e and achieve meaningful and substantive improvements to disclosure standards. And from that standpoint, we appreciate that the Commission has created an opportunity to improve the 13 F standard in ways that matter to everyone.

Jennifer Heller,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-221928.htm,,"Jul. 31, 2020 To Whom it May Concern: I am writing today, on behalf of Brandywine Group Advisors, Inc. and Brandywine Managers, LLC (operating a single registered investment advisory business), to express our strong opposition to File Number S7-08-20, which suggests substantially raising the AUM threshold for 13F filing. Brandywine Group Advisors a registered investment advisor with regulatory assets over $10bn. I am the Chief Investment Officer of the firm, and I have been investing on behalf of families, endowments, and foundations for 20 years. We invest, as most endowments, foundations, and pensions do, largely by allocating our capital to investment managers. We take our fiduciary duties exceptionally seriously, and ensuring that these managers are responsible guardians of our capital is no small task. While best practices have been established, and much thought been given, to how performance is reported, investment managers have substantial flexibility over how and what they choose to report to us on their actual portfolio holdings. We have thus found 13F filings to be one of our most valuable tools to hold managers accountable on many levels. The holding-level detail provided by these filings helps us answer critical questions, a small sample of which I’ve provided below: Do we note any mismatches between a fund’s stated strategy and the types of investments in their portfolio? If we have a healthcare manager who is suddenly purchasing tech stocks, for example, this can lead to an important line of questioning. Are we comfortable with the level of concentration we note amongst the top holdings? Are we comfortable with the liquidity of the underlying holdings relative to the fund’s asset base or liquidity terms? What purchase and sale decisions does a manager make over time and why (relative to the selective information we might receive in a quarterly letter)? How does a manager’s portfolio shift as his or her AUM grows or shrinks—what are the changes, for example, in the underlying market cap of positions In what sectors has a manager made or lost money over the long-term, and how might this compare to what the manager tells us he/she does well? The SEC has an incredibly challenging job of serving as a watchdog across all investment managers, and the smaller managers, we imagine, might be the hardest to track based on their numerosity alone. On the other hand, endowments, foundations, and family offices often seek out small and medium sized managers (below $3.5bn in AUM) in whom to invest because we believe these managers are playing a much easier chess game: we are all in the business of maximizing risk-adjusted returns, and these smaller funds can take advantage of inefficiencies in the market that larger funds cannot access at scale. Allowing us, as institutional investors, all the tools we need to keep a close watch on these smaller managers is greatly enhances the transparency and safety of the system as a whole. We file a 13-F ourselves. We speak with our managers regularly, and even those firms with small teams and limited assets have managed very successfully to comply with this SEC requirement as part of their regular-way business. The information in the 13F is information they have at their fingertips, and in 20 years I can’t think of a single investment manager who has stated that they would defer the growth of their firm or asset base due to this particular filing requirement. We pay these managers healthy management fees to do just that, and typically the partnerships and funds managed by smaller investment firms pay the costs associated with regulatory filings, not the managers themselves. As an institutional investor who pays these costs regularly, it is a burden we welcome in exchange for the transparency this filing provides us. Thank you for your time and consideration. With greatest respect, Jennifer Heller President & Chief Investment Officer Brandywine Group Advisors"

Creating and compiling a detailed and color-coded review of 13-F filings is greatly beneficial for the two fund-of-fund products that I work for. Perhaps a better way to reduce front-running and retail investors / allocators cherry picking long ideas from hard-working hedge fund managers is to require more stringent compliance policies on allocators which prevent them from investing in long positions held by hedge fund managers at quarter-ends. My firm already does that as we are required to report all trades that are not mutual funds or ETFs on a quarterly basis. The portfolio manager, CFO/CCO and I (senior analyst) have never invested in a single-stock name since our first fund-of-funds product began operating in 2006, yet this law would kill us in terms of transparency that we could use to measure strategy drift, the liquidity of underlying positions and portfolio management tactics utilized by hedge funds such as trading around positions, remaining emotionally sound and adding to positions during market drawdowns in which a company with strong fundamentals sees its share price punished by the market, whether the fund utilizes stop losses, etc."

I am a recent graduate of the University of Miami and a capital markets analyst at JP Morgan. I just wanted to write in to show my support for the rule changes in regard to becoming an accredited investor. In particular, I believe allowing licensed professionals the ability to become accredited investors will increase economic security for those who have traditionally been disenfranchised. As an African American, my community has just begun building generational wealth. For most of US history, US policy and the business community have stifled wealth generation for African Americans by unfairly denying access to credit, using eminent domain to destroy home equity in African American communities, discriminating against African Americans in the workplace, among other injustices. As a result, African American's have a fraction of the wealth white Americans have after adjusted for the level of education. Changing the accredited investor's rules will have a positive impact on African American's and other disenfranchised people. It will be a small step in closing the wealth inequality gap between African American's and white Americans. For those like myself, the ability to increase our participation in private markets could potentially lead to increased economic security, which would then flow back to our families and communities. This is particularly important because startups stay private for longer, allowing accredited investors and other institutions to capture most of the gains. Additionally, increasing access to private credit markets will allow families more opportunities to invest in fixed income, thus providing more opportunities to create economic security. Please consider allowing licensed professionals the ability to become accredited investors. We have more than enough knowledge to make sound decisions and increasing access to private markets will have a positive impact on wall Street as well as the main street. Best, Nosa James"

The new rule involves 13F data. Currently, any institutional money manager with more than $100 million in assets under management must file a 13F document detailing their holdings. These 13F filings are how we know what stocks investors like Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and many others bought, sold or held in any quarter. Its useful information for individual investors. The new rule proposes that the $100 million threshold be raised to $3.5 billion. Buffett, Icahn and Ackman would still be required to file, as they are giants in the industry. But 90% of other institutions would not. In the first quarter of 2020, 5,293 institutions filed 13Fs. Under the new proposal, that number would have dropped to 549. Its not just a matter of seeing which individual star money managers bought and sold stock. Knowing if institutions are collectively buying or selling certain stocks is important information – and its useful for companies to know who their shareholders are as well. The strange thing is that the SEC claims it wants to increase transparency in the market, yet this rule will do exactly the opposite It will hide the transactions and holdings of all but the very largest institutions, keeping average investors in the dark about what the smart money is buying and selling. Daniel Collins of WhaleWisdom says Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors dont. Given the SECs emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. One SEC commissioner has come out against the proposal.

Washington, DC 20549 Re: File No. S7-08-20; Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers (SEC Release No. 34-89290) Dear Ms. Countryman, BondView is pleased to respond to the request for public comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on the proposed change to the reporting thresholds under rule 13f for fund managers. Summary: We respectfully disagree with the proposal to increase the reporting threshold from $100m to $3.5bbn since we believe it would be disadvantageous to retail investors. If a publicly traded fund enjoys the benefits of being traded in the U.S. public market, then its reasonable for the investing public to expect complete transparency of all fund holdings rather than only those funds over $3.5bn in market value. BondView’s mission includes helping improve transparency for retail investors by providing market data and analysis on the $3.7 trillion municipal bond and fund marketplace which includes about 1.5 mil bonds from 50,000 issuers. Our comments below are focused on the municipal bond fund marketplace but apply to other funds as well. 1) Rather than remove 13f filing requirements on publicly traded funds below $3.5bn, we suggest a requirement for complete reporting by ALL publicly traded funds regardless of size. Detailed fund holdings data, as provided through 13f filings, can be used by investors to assess the real risk and liquidity of the funds they own by reviewing the actual contents of the fund. Many fund strategies give significant leeway to the manager to invest in a wide range of securities outside the obvious advertised scope of the fund. This leeway would not necessarily be revealed to retail fund investors if fund holdings were no longer reported and funds could conceal investments which fund investors might not be comfortable with. Requiring complete transparency helps ensure investors are not subject to buying into unsuitable investments. The following is an example where if the proposed 13f rule change were to become law, retail investors would be at a severe disadvantage because of hidden risks in their fund investments. Figure 1 on the following page shows fund holdings data derived from BondView as of July 22, 2020. 2 Figure 1 BondView Fund Example. Contact Us For Details On This Exact Fund. Figure 1 shows an example of a current publicly traded municipal bond fund with assets of about $143m named Fund Family XYZ Double Tax-Free Income A. In our opinion, unless it was explicitly disclosed, it is unlikely the average investor can decipher that this fund owns about 45% of its bond holdings in mostly defaulted Puerto Rico bonds. If the proposed 13f 3 rule were enacted, retail investors and their financial advisors would have no way to know this fund is unsuitable for the average investor in a tax-favored municipal bond fund who is typically looking for a safe source of income. The fund family name XYZ is anonymized but the remaining fund descriptive name, “Double Tax-Free Income A, is real. However, this name is not descriptive as to its investment scope and instead investors could be led to believe they would be buying various “Double Tax-Free bonds”. Retail investors in tax-favored municipal bond funds are typically looking for a relatively safe source of income. We drilled down deeper to see this fund owns about 45% of its investment holdings in Puerto Rico bonds, most of which are deeply distressed. Appendix A shows a list of all Puerto Rico bonds held by this fund. Since the fund’s total market value is below $3.5bn, its holdings would not have been required to be reported under the SEC’s newly proposed loosening of rule 13f. Puerto Rico bonds are high-risk investments, partially due to their widespread default rates, and any municipal bond fund owning an undisclosed significant percentage of Puerto Rico bonds may be far riskier than investors were led to believe and is therefore unsuitable. All fund’s full holdings must be disclosed so that retail investors can make an informed decision rather than be saddled with a highly speculative investment. 2) All funds, regardless of market size, should be required to report their holdings down to the security identifier level. This is a concern with some municipal bond funds which do not include security identifiers (CUSIP, FIGI, etc.) in their current 13f filings. This results in masking their specific holdings since there can be multiple bonds in a series with the same name. Without the security identifier it is not possible to know which bond the fund owns and the associated risks. A quick internet search reveals that some leading free financial sites do not report the detailed bond holdings for most bond funds which leaves retail investors in the dark. So rather than loosen 13f filing requirements, it would be beneficial for all retail investors if fund reporting was completely transparent regardless of fund size. In addition, all bond funds should be required to report their holdings down to the security identifier level (IE, CUSIP, FIGI). This help ensure that retail investors have a level playing field from which to make informed decisions. 3) Municipal bond funds below $3.5bn represent the overwhelming majority of the number of funds and nearly half the total market value of all municipal bond’s funds. Under the proposed 13f rule change, the majority of municipal bond funds would no longer be required to report under a changed Rule 13f, thereby reducing transparency for all retail investors. Municipal bond funds below $3.5bn make up the overwhelming majority of all funds. Looking specifically at municipal bond funds, those below $3.5bn comprise about 41% of all funds in total market value and 90.5% of the actual number of funds. Municipal bond funds bigger than $3.5bn make up about 59% of all funds in total value but only about 9.5% of the actual number of funds. 4 4) A portion of market data vendors is made up of small businesses who rely on 13f data to create products that help improve transparency for retail investors. Eliminating 13f data for funds below $3.5bn will stifle competition and further concentrate the information flow into the hands of a few large market data vendors. Fund holdings data is used to feed important market measures of fund risk and liquidity. For instance, BondView has developed a municipal bond index (BondView 500) based in part on reviewing the fund holdings of municipal bonds. The central theme of this approach is to review widely & deeply held bonds owned by professionally managed mutual funds. Since funds employ smart credit analysts who review risk prior to making investing decisions, 13f filings enable us to see these filings, consolidate the holdings data and share that information with retail investors. BondView has also built a low-cost-thorough set of tools for complying with SEC Rule 22e-4 for liquidity assessment that relies on 13f holdings data. Without complete fund data holdings, it will be very difficult for smaller vendors to continue to offer low-cost innovative tools that shed light onto the broad municipal bond fund marketplace. This could make it more difficult for investors to review and assess the true risks of their funds. 5) On the SEC’s web site, there seems to be an overwhelming majority of comments against the proposed rule by the investing public. We read thru all the published public comments on the proposed 13f rule change. As of 7/24/20, there were 869 comments on the proposed rule and about 99% of the comments were against the rule. It is worth noting that most of those comments seem to be from individual investors. This is appropriate since they are most potentially impacted by the proposed rule change. In closing, it is our opinion that the proposed change to Rule 13f would irreparably harm the ability of retail investors to make informed investment decisions and therefore it should not be passed into law. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspectives on the current proposal.

What is to prevent any institutional money manager from setting up separate entities wherein they could move assets under management below the $100 million threshold to avoid any transparent reporting?

Chad W. Gassaway,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7488745-221426.htm,,"July 28, 2020 Proposed rule number S7-08-20 would result in asset managers increasing the reporting thresholds for Form 13F filing from $100 million to $3.5 billion. Regulatory burdens placed on moderate sized funds are already enormous. While filing fees are low, costs related to time and effort to prepare yet another filing increases reporting costs and decreases returns to the fund and its investors. As stated by the SEC, $68.1 to $136 million in direct costs will be saved by the industry and in turn investors. While some will claim that industry transparency will be reduced, in no other industry are companies required to divulge their proprietary strategies. At what point in time has a standard bank been required to turn over specifics on all of their loan holdings? When has a tech company been required to release details on their RD division? Moreover, commodity, futures, and bond positions are not required to be included and those funds are given a proprietary advantage as well, yet are in the same industry. While many retail traders follow select managers through their 13F holdings, the delay in making the information public often results in chasing returns. The portfolio may no longer hold the underlying security, investment time horizons may differ (e.g., swing or buy and hold), and risk tolerance is not included, and may in fact can be detrimental to non-accredited investors who only blindly follow trades that are inappropriate for their goals and risk appetite. For example, if long SP puts, it is not known if this is a hedging strategy or if the company is bearish the market and can mislead retail investors. Additionally, an unsophisticated investor may view the 13F for a company such as quantitative and HFT shop Jump Trading. While returns may be outstanding, in no way can they emulate these returns with their lack of technology. Finally, as short positions are not included, portfolio construction can be vastly skewed from reality. Is this an outright long or a pair trade? Only an insider would know. Any investor owning more than 5% of outstanding shares of a publicly held must continue to file a 13D or 13G. As a result, those with significant influence will continue to be known by both the fund and other investors. If needed, ownership may be requested through the transfer agent as well. The SEC has and will continue to have the right to regulate and oversee securities markets and its participants, however, fund managers costs will decrease, proprietary strategies will be protected, and retail investors will not be fed outdated data. Despite the negative headlines, the proposed rule would be industry beneficial and those benefits may result in retail traders taking ownership of their own portfolios."

I say NO to this proposed new rule"
David S,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-221605.htm,,"Jul. 27, 2020 Hello, According to SEC.gov, ""The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation"". This proposed rule directly violates the second guiding principle of the SEC. This rule does not protect retail investors. This rule will inhibit retail investors to make investment decisions based on simple supply/demand market fundamentals and create a knowledge bias among investment groups. This rule does not promote or maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. In case there is any misinterpretation of the phrase ""efficient markets"", a definition has been provided. ""Market efficiency refers to the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information."" - a widely accepted definition, provided by Investopedia.com. By limiting the amount of relevant information available to investors via raising the Form 13F reporting threshold, market efficiency will be degraded. The proposed change of the 13F reporting threshold cites two objectives of the change. 1) ""...enabling the SEC to monitor holdings of larger investment managers"". Thankfully, the SEC already does this. There is no need to cite it as an objective for the proposed change. 2) ""Reducing unnecessary burdens on smaller managers."" This is a logical fallacy called a ""hasty generalization"". The phrase, ""unnecessary burdens"" has no agreed-upon measure for sufficient evidence. If only fund managers were asked if the 13F filings were necessary, then surely the majority response would be some variation of, ""No"". These filings are an important source of information to the retail investor community for making investment decisions and are deemed necessary, no matter the size of the managed fund. Saving Fund Managers from Compliance Costs According to the proposal, the ""total annual direct compliance cost savings for smaller managers who would no longer file reports on Form 13F would range from $68.1 million to $136 million."" The proposal also states, ""compliance costs could range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager"". These costs work out to be well below the tax savings fund managers are already privileged to. Since fund managers use carried interest as their primary mechanism for income - taxed at the capital gains rate of 20%, their tax advantage already exceeds 15%, when compared to the 37% federal income tax rate. This tax advantage provides fund managers with additional financing for anticipated business expenses, like compliance costs. All businesses have operations expenses, no matter the industry. No data has been provided to show detailed compliance costs incurred by fund managers, nor has data been provided to show any cost cutting attempts by fund managers and the results thereof. Using the objectives stated in the proposal as the foundation for the 13F threshold rule change is irresponsible and will have a negative impact on future U.S. market dynamics, as well as a negative impact on the SEC's reputation among the retail investor community. Increasing the reporting threshold from $100M to $3.5B will create opaque barriers between retail investors and the investment decisions that account for much of the market's movement.

David Sheets,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7488983-221686.htm,,"July 27, 2020 Hello, According to SEC.gov, ""The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation"". This proposed rule directly violates the second guiding principle of the SEC. This rule does not protect retail investors.This rule will inhibit retail investors to make investment decisions based on simple supply/demand market fundamentals and create a knowledge bias among investment groups. This rule does not promote or maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.In case there is any misinterpretation of the phrase ""efficient markets"", a definition has been provided. ""Market efficiency refers to the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information."" - a widely accepted definition, provided by Investopedia.com. By limiting the amount of relevant information available to investors via raising the Form 13F reporting threshold, market efficiency will be degraded.The proposed change of the 13F reporting threshold cites two objectives of the change.1) ""...enabling the SEC to monitor holdings of larger investment managers"". Thankfully, the SEC already does this. There is no need to cite it as an objective for the proposed change.2) ""Reducing unnecessary burdens on smaller managers.""This is a logical fallacy called a ""hasty generalization"". The phrase, ""unnecessary burdens"" has no agreed-upon measure for sufficient evidence. If only fund managers were asked if the 13F filings were necessary, then surely the majority response would be some variation of, ""No"". These filings are an important source of information to the retail investor community for making investment decisions and are deemed necessary, no matter the size of the managed fund. Saving Fund Managers from Compliance CostsAccording to the proposal, the ""total annual direct compliance cost savings for smaller managers who would no longer file reports on Form 13F would range from $68.1 million to $136 million."" The proposal also states, ""compliance costs could range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager"". These costs work out to be well below the tax savings fund managers are already privileged to. Since fund managers use carried interest as their primary mechanism for income - taxed at the capital gains rate of 20%, their tax advantage already exceeds 15%, when compared to the 37% federal income tax rate. This tax advantage provides fund managers with additional financing for anticipated business expenses, like compliance costs. All businesses have operations expenses, no matter the industry. No data has been provided to show detailed compliance costs incurred by fund managers, nor has data been provided to show any cost cutting attempts by fund managers and the results thereof. Using the objectives stated in the proposal as the foundation for the 13F threshold rule change is irresponsible and will have a negative impact on future U.S. market dynamics, as well as a negative impact on the SEC's reputation among the retail investor community. Increasing the reporting threshold from $100M to $3.5B will create opaque barriers between retail investors and the investment decisions that account for much of the market's movement.

By doubling the limit to $200 million, you will be providing a 38% reduction in the number of managers that have to file form 13F. This is a significant reduction of filers and will provide relief to those smaller firms you appear to be concerned about.

The wealth gap in our country is largely a result of wealthy insiders having access to information and data that is difficult or impossible for the average investor to access or afford. I hope the SEC will not go forward with their contemplated change to raise to a great degree the dollar limit for those entities who must report information regarding their financial dealings. Daniel Collins of WhaleWisdom says... Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. One SEC commissioner has come out against the proposal.

This hurts amongst others the lay man who invests for his or her pension, either via a 401K, IRA or corporate pension fund. The cost for asset managers to comply is negligible as it is automated.

Under current rules , any institutional money manager with more than $100 million in assets under management must file a 13F document detailing their holdings. These 13F filings provide useful information for individual investors to know what stocks investors like Warren Buffet, Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and many others bought, sold or held in any quarter. . However, t he new rule proposes that the $100 million threshold be raised to $3.5 billion . Giants in the industry such as Buffett, Icahn and Ackman would still be required to file ; but 90% of other institutions would not be required to file under a $3.5 billion threshold!! In the first quarter of 2020, 5,293 institutions filed 13Fs , but u nder the new proposal, that number would have dropped to 549. It's not just a matter of seeing which individual star money managers bought and sold stock. Knowing if institutions are collectively buying or selling certain stocks is importa nt information - and it's useful for companies to know who their shareholders are as well. This will not increase transparency in the market ; this rule will do exactly the opposite... It will hide the transactions and holdings of all but the very largest institutions, keeping average investors in the dark about what the “smart money” is buying and selling. I agree with o ne SEC commissioner who has come out against the proposal --Allison Herren Lee stated, ""This proposal joins a long list of recent actions that decrease transparency and reduce both the Commission's and the public's access to information about our markets."" I use 13F information when analyzing stocks --who is buying and selling and i f they are starting a new position in a stock . If I lose 90% of institutions and only have access to 10% --the little guy just got screwed again. Remember, MORE information is better for little guys AND big guys. Please do not increase the threshold!! Sincerely, Retired 401(k)/ Benefits Manager"

When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the US securities markets. Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets.Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. The reasoning behind the proposed change is the possible reduction in costs and burdens to smaller managers. This justification is nonsense. I have asked several managers that file and they say it is a highly automated process that effectively costs nothing. The claimed cost savings are completely inaccurate.One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to this proposal. https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10The proposed rule change would be a loss for the main street investor. The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. This can only hurt small investors and provides little to no benefit or savings.Here is a list of issues of how this personally affects me and many other small investors Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more. To finalize, this would be a terrible move for the small invetor who is highly dependent on this information which creates the transparency in the US stock market and consequently trust in the same system. This change would negatively affect said trust and the reputation of the US stock exchange."

This change is unnecessary as there is no financial ""burden"" on small to medium hedge fund managers in filing these quarterly forms given the average profits of hedge funds. Also, the idea that it will reduce ""copycatters"" is invalid since fund managers are allowed to wait 45 days until filing so short-term strategies are safe. To add, fund managers are only reporting long positions, shorts are not included. President Roosevelt and Congress created the SEC to increase transparency and investor confidence, not reduce it. This proposed change can also encourage activist hedge funds to ""go dark"" and make it more difficult to determine who owns stake in a company. If we want to account for inflation, the $100 million threshold could be increased to $400 million or less, not $3.5 billion. Bottom line, this change will only help hedge funds (who don't need the help) and hurt individual retail investors. The public deserves to know who owns what, as it has been for over 40 years.

I think there are some points in your proposed rule No. 34-89290 (Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers) that you should reconsider: 1) You estimate cost savings of $68.1 million to $136 million for investment managers. I think that is a very high estimate because the creation of the 13F Filings (even for small investment managers) is just an very small block of additional costs relative to the other inhouse reportings, which in 2020 is highly automated (which was the case not in 1975). One investment manager from New York (with AUM below $500 million) told me, that for him the time effort and costs for 13F Filing is indeed just a small side effort of his regular monthly reporting for customers. 2) The corresponding loss of transparency should be argument enough to refuse the reduction of the reporting threshold. Here in Germany we see at the example of the Wirecard scandal once more, that regulators should rather tend to increase transparency (not decrease it) to protect investors. 3) You mention indirect costs because of the potential danger for managers to face indirect costs because of copycatting. That logic doesnt make sense for smaller investment managers but rather for large institutions, which have to split the transaction over several days or weeks (over the last calendar day of a quarter): Theoretical a institution which is very large (and very popular, so that copycatting would be rather likely) could have an theoretical disadvantage because copycatters who follow them, could raise a share price with their additional demand, so it would be more difficult for a large institution to handle a multi-week or multi-week order flow at lower prices. But for smaller investment managers this logic doesnt make sense. I hope you think about it once again and refuse the reduction of the 13F threshold."

Frankly at the time when we need more transparency, this change appears to be yet another action directed by a corrupt administration that has done its best to give away everything to the super rich at the expense of everyone else. The expense of preparing the quarterly report is minimal since the reports are automated and the cost is certainly negligible compared to the money that the hedge funds rake in. So one can only wonder what the real sense of urgency is and what is the real motivation behind this change. 1) Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. 1) Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are. 2) Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense. 3) The justification for the rule change is highly questionable. When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor? 4) Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. 5) In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

I recently became aware of the proposal to alter the reporting threshold for money managers to report their various long positions. As an ordinary citizen with no special contacts, access to sophisticated computer algorithms, high tech software to analyze the market, or a dedicated staff of personnel to assist me, I rely heavily on ANY publicly available information I can access. Furthermore, as a singular citizen with little to no influence on multi-million dollar firms and such, many like me depend on the SEC to provide full and complete transparency of any firm who manages money on behalf of us citizens. Anything that reduces such transparency is, in my view, inherently bad. Having read the well written commentary by Commissioner Allison Herren Lee and her rationale for opposing this proposal, I can summarily say that the one and only justification held by firms requesting this change is around the cost of reporting and how burdensome it is. And while I can't express my views as eloquently as Commissioner Lee, what I can say is abundantly clear is this: If these $100 million money managers were faced with figuring out a far better way to manage the funds they were entrusted with, they would put all measures of effort into maximizing gains, even IF that meant a slightly larger burden on reporting. In other words, the argument that said reporting is too cost burdensome and for better or worse, is not a valid reason for depriving the general public of the safety, transparency, and core checks and balances that us EVEN SMALLER investors rely on for all manner of reasons. I will further state that instead of pursuing a reduction in the 13-F rules, we should EXPAND this rule to include both long AND short positions held, we as any other notable instruments that can serve as a proxy for stocks / equities. I say this because I'm simply not very knowledgeable in this area. But I've been around long enough to know that if a firm wants to hide their actions and stocks don't offer that, they are very adept and creative at finding other ways to evade monitoring and detection. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my comments. I realize they probably differ substantially from what you are accustomed to get.

Transparency is important to protect investors. The need for public disclosure of holdings for medium-size fund managers is to enable investors to evaluate investment alternatives. Raising the filing threshold to $3.5 Billion would eliminate the filing requirement for three-quarters of currently-filing fund managers, leaving investors without this important disclosure to evaluate the majority of their investment alternatives. It is hard to see how this action protects investors. If the burden of Form 13F filing is perceived to be a burden to small fund managers, raising the filing threshold to $350 million, in line with inflation since the previous threshold was set in 1975, could be justified, rather than elevating the reporting threshold to the proposed $3.5 Billion and effectively eliminating this requirement for the vast majority of managers."

It does a fine job summarizing the flaws of this proposed rule change: The SEC has proposed an amendment to Form 13F that would exempt from filing all money managers holding less than $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities. The threshold would apply without regard to the funds overall size or total assets under management. Increasing the threshold to $3.5 billion from the current cut-off of $100 million would slash the number of reporting filers by 90%, from 5,089 to 550, effectively abolishing Form 13F as a reporting system for most investors, including many activist and event-driven hedge funds, and preserve it only for the largest index funds and asset managers. Form 13F generally requires investment managers holding more than $100 million of such 13(f) securities (typically Exchange-traded equity securities, certain options and warrants, shares of closed-end investment companies and certain convertible debt securities) to disclose their holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter, and is often the primary means by which investors, companies and other market participants first learn or verify that an activist hedge fund is accumulating or has accumulated a significant (but less than 5%) position in a target companys stock. Because many activists do not own $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities, adoption of this revision would permit them to go dark and make it significantly more difficult to determine whether an activist, or a wolf pack of activists, owns a stake in a company. Indeed, as we have previously discussed, activist tipping could well result in only the wolf pack—and not the target company or other shareholders—being aware of the ownership stake until the moment that the activist strike occurs. In proposing the revision, the SEC has suggested that the new threshold will further the primary goals of Form 13F, including gathering data about investment activities of institutional investment managers facilitating consideration of the impact of these managers on the securities markets and increasing investor confidence in the integrity of the securities markets. It is difficult to see how eliminating the limited transparency into ownership by activist and other hedge funds, and instead increasing the percentage of 13(f) information provided by price-taking index funds rather than smaller active funds that set prices, will further those goals. Contrary to both the original intent of Rule 13(f) and the current market use of 13(f) information, adoption of the SECs current proposal would impede companies and their shareholders from promptly identifying the companys institutional investors, hinder shareholder/public company engagement, and increase the potential for market abuse by sophisticated investors who wish to accumulate shares on a stealth basis. The SEC asserted that the benefits of the proposed change include potential annual savings of approximately $15,000-$30,000 per smaller manager, and reduction of indirect costs to smaller managers such as front running and copycatting. The smaller managers that would save these amounts and be relieved of this disclosure obligation would reportedly include some of the most well-known hedge fund names (such as David Tepper, David Einhorn, and John Paulson) and other activist investors, as well as funds whose overall assets under management are far in excess of the threshold. While Elliott Management, Pershing Square and Carl Icahn may currently be above the threshold, other well-known activist investors who have either long been below the $3.5 billion 13(f) line or have, at times, fallen below it, include Corvex Management, JANA Partners, Legion Partners, Land Buildings, Sachem Head and even Starboard Value, among many others. The SEC also noted that the academic literature supporting its views concerning indirect costs provide, at best, partial evidence, and generally did not demonstrate harm to the reporting entities related to the front running and copycatting issues that the SEC suggested might be problematic. The SECs proposal flies in the face of the transparency and engagement demanded by investors, asset managers and companies, including the very sensible 13(f) rulemaking petition filed in 2013 by NYSE Euronext, the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals and the National Investor Relations Institute, the 13(d) rulemaking petition that we filed in 2011, and many other calls for change in these reporting rules. The 13(f) petition sought a shortening of the 13(f) reporting deadline from 45 days to two business days after the relevant quarter, as well as monthly rather than quarterly reporting. As noted in the 13(f) petition, the 45-day reporting period—implemented over 35 years ago—was borne of practical considerations that are entirely antiquated in light of the increased sophistication of institutional investors and advances in information technology. Our 13(d) rulemaking petition would require prompt disclosure of meaningful stakes, with timing windows and disclosure levels consistent with other major financial markets. Just as the SEC should not have allowed common-sense improvement of the 13(f) and 13(d) regimes to languish unaddressed for nearly a decade, it should not continue to do so now. Nor should it gut the reporting system by rendering it inapplicable to all but the largest reporting investors, reducing market transparency and burdening shareholder engagement, at the same time that other securities markets around the globe have improved market transparency and the timely and complete disclosure of ownership information. We continue to believe that immediate SEC action is required to further the principles of market transparency and fairness that are the foundation of Section 13. U.S. public companies, and all stakeholders with an interest in securities market transparency and efficiency, should oppose adoption of the SECs proposal, and support proposals that would increase transparency in shareholder ownership, including the long-pending 13(f) and 13(d) rulemaking petitions noted above."

Dear Chairman Clayton: I’m writing to protest the proposed change to Form 13F that will raise the limit beyond which hedge funds and other large trading groups are legally required to report their stock trades on a regular basis. This strikes me as being yet another instance where the SEC is disposed to favor big traders at the expense of the small, retail trader like myself, allowing those big traders to keep secret the kind of information about changes in their investing policies that can often be useful to small traders in assessing market direction. I appreciate that you’ve posted this proposed change for public comment, and I hope there will be many retail traders who, like me, express concern over this new development.

A large number of hedge funds are under the 3.5billion threshold and therefore small and individual investors such as me will no longer get information on who owns what. Secondly, for an organization or institution that raises and invests / manages billions or even several hundred million dollars, quarterly reporting should not pose any significant cost or burden. Thirdly the proposal does not quantify how much the cost savings and expense reduction on the SEC side will be at what threshold. For example, at thresholds of 200M / 300M/....1Billion and so on, the potential reduction in SEC costs including number of jobs that will be reduced, should be published to enable an objective decision on this. Finally, if an institution does not have appropriate technology and controls implemented to be able to file the required quarterly reports, whether 100M or 3.5B the threshold be, that institution is not fit to be in business. The proposed change will shield such instiutions. SEC MUST strive for more transparency in order to regulate and protect the investors. The proposed change reduces the transparency as described and therefore should not be approved."

Most large hedge funds have AUM of 1 billion to 3 billion, so all the major hedge funds would be exempt from reporting If anything, the AUM requirement should be about $400 million, which accounts for inflation instead of the market growth calculation used here. I think an industry regulator should be enacting protections for the retail investor and not the other way around. This proposal should require the reporting of not only long positions, which it already does but also short positions. This would provide huge insight to where the institutional investors think the market is headed. More information provided to the market albeit delayed will create a more efficient market which is the goal. Please do not fall victim to lining your pockets and looking the other just because big money is tired of reporting their long positions.

I do not believe that simply adjusting the reporting limit for inflation to $500M places a significant burden on financial managers, especially given the advances in technology available to these managers in 2020 versus what existed in 1975. More importantly, today's markets require more transparency, not less. Given the complexities of financial markets and instruments in today's world, requiring more reporting is a small price to pay for managers, while it will instill much greater confidence in all Americans who use these instruments.

Since when is less transparency and less data ever a good thing? The only people this change will benefit are the players already big enough to actively manipulate the market simply by the sheer volume of their plays, but now with this change they will have the benefit of doing it without warning. For instance, some investors (myself included) may want to avoid stocks over-owned by players who have a history of pseudo market manipulation due to the high level of risk they encourage. This rule change greatly reduces my ability to reduce my own risk and gives even more power to those who have more to gain and less to lose from market volatility from the beginning. Not only that but the ""justification"" for the rule changes are highly questionable to begin with, but in the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.

I disagree with the premise that we should look at how much the value of the equity markets have increased in the last 30 years and apply that rate of return to the $100 million limit. I think that results in too high of a limit. There are a significant amount of smaller money managers and it is important to retain public disclosure rules for those managers. They have processes in place to ensure compliance with the rules and I would imagine their fee structures charged to clients consider those compliance fees. If you were to remove the filing requirements for those money managers than it's likely they eliminate workers or keep additional profits for themselves which results in the rich getting richer.

"Faryan Amir-Ghassemi, Partner/CIO, Epsilon Asset Management",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7455216-221027.htm,,"July 21, 2020 We are respectfully submitting our comments against the central proposed change set forth in S7-08-20, Release No. 34-89290. This refers to the change in filing threshold proposed by the SEC for holders of 13F securities. It is our humble contention that the cost/benefit analysis presented by SEC for said change misses the mark on both sides of the equation. In our view, SECs focus was aimed at providing regulatory relief to smaller asset managers, which on its face is welcome. However, it is our contention that it does an incomplete job of accurately reflecting the de minimis cost associated with said filing. It is our belief that the methodology presented in the proposal to estimate cost is inflated and hard to reconcile with tangible experience. Our belief was already articulated by SEC Commissioner Lee in her public retort (July 10, 2020) to said proposal. As Commissioner Lee so eloquently described, SECs estimation of per manager cost associated with 13F filing represents a nearly 400% cost inflation versus their prior robust analysis, conducted less than 2 years ago. This is a curious development. Furthermore, it contradicts a reasonable expectation of cost deflation associated with an easily automatable task. Such automations need not be the job of the investment manager and have been made readily available by numerous counterparties (e.g., brokers, custodians, administrators), largely for free. These innovations have only accelerated in recent years since the SECs migration to XML filing for Form 13F in 2013. Given our belief that the task of generating a Form 13F is both simple and easily rules based, it is reasonable to expect this filing cost to follow most commodity-function cost curves. This is our central point of disagreement with the purported cost-benefit of regulatory relief. Far more importantly, the diminished transparency proposed by SEC levies a huge cost that is bizarrely unaccounted for in the proposal. It is our central contention that SEC did not adequately address the costs born by various members of the domestic equity capital market ecosystem. Principally, institutional investors (LPs), corporates, academics, and the public writ large will be harmed by this change. To summarize each: Direct Harm to LPs and academics - The proposed change damages the LP community, which uses 13F transparency as a tool for oversight and diligence for non-transparent managers- The proposed change damages the LP and academic community by eliminating an analytical lens of aggregate hedge fund manager behavior across US equities, for which there is no ready substitute Indirect Harm to Capital Markets (GPs and Corporates) - the proposed change damages capital market efficiency, notably for small and mid-sized corporates – which on average have more active ownership and rely on 13Fs for visibility into their own shareholder base- the proposed change damages active managers who benefit from coordinating with other shareholders to improve corporate governance habits through their shareholder rights Given an incomplete analysis of both purported savings and added costs, we are respectfully but vehemently against the heart of the proposal. There are several other minor changes proposed by SEC, to which we provide comments and feedback in our itemized responses to their questions. To summarize, these ancillary changes are net beneficial. Respectfully,Faryan Amir-Ghassemi Michael PerlowEpsilon Asset Management --- 1. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1? Is the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion appropriate? If another threshold would be more appropriate, what should the threshold be and why? It is our belief that an upward adjustment for the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1 has significant costs associated with it, as it pertains to the transparency afforded to institutional investors, as well as publicly traded corporates. When these costs are appropriately accounted for, the value of an upward adjustment is quite bleak. We further believe the reporting burden as purported by SEC is vastly inflated given the plethora of technological tools available to simply export a list of long equity holdings through XML. As such, the decision behind a threshold increase seems specious at best. 2. Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(f) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? If so, how? And if so, is there a different threshold that would be more appropriate? Are there any additional effects of raising the Form 13F reporting threshold that we have not considered? It is our firm belief that raising the threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion will negative affect the utility of the data as well as investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. Markets. We believe so for several reasons: - Investors (namely qualified purchasers) of non-transparent investment firms (namely private partnerships) will lose a key form of oversight as to the investment activities of these firms. This will damage the LP community which uses this information source to strength the principal / agent relationship between GPs and LPs. - While it is true that (as of 12/31/2018), 90.8 percent of the dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data would be retained with this proposal, the vast majority of that dollar value would be associated with passive investment firms, for which the transparency provides relatively limited value compared to that of active private partnerships. - The majority of dollar value transparency lost will come from active participation in US securities, which act as marginal price-setters of securities. This will have an amplified impact in terms of reducing shareholder and corporate transparency. - If there is value in this information in lowering the cost of capital formation and improving the functioning of capital markets (it is our contention that there is), this will damage those positive benefits. - Given the disproportionate participation of active owners in smaller and mid capitalization securities, it will also disproportionately harm those portions of the market. 3. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Boards flow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis for this calculation? Anchoring a change in threshold to the growth in U.S. equities is not (in our opinion) an appropriate gauge. This is because the nature of complexion of U.S. capital markets have changed tremendously over the last 4 decades, namely through the rise of intermediaries that act as agents on behalf of an increasingly larger institutional ownership base of U.S. equities. If anything, given the increased importance of the financial sector as a function of the US economy, greater regulatory oversight of these intermediaries could be argued. 4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively reflect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? For example, under this approach, we could take the market size as of the end of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, average those values, and compare that average to the size of the U.S. equities market in 1975. If so, why? Is such a five-year period (or other period) more appropriate for calculating an average growth rate to apply over the 45 years since the threshold was initially set? We are against such a metric, for the reasons above (e.g., response #3), but also because such a drastic change would adversely impact the expanded benefit of 13F disclosure, causing a net cost to the aggregate ecosystem. 5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis for this calculation? If so, how should we measure stock market returns? For example, would dividends be included or excluded? Is there another measure that we should use as a basis for initially adjusting the reporting threshold? See #4. 6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F to account for consumer price inflation? If so, what measure of consumer price inflation—PCE or CPI—should we use? Is there another measure of consumer price inflation (or other inflation measure) that we should use? If so, what? See #4 7. Should we adopt a different rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3.6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a different rounding convention, why? We have no perspective on this matter. 8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? We personally do not believe so, given the accumulation of ones exposures is manifold to basic portfolio and risk management for a registered investment adviser. The exporting of such data to the SEC through EDGAR has become trivially easy due to technological integration. For example, Epsilons brokerage platform affords for easy and free export of Form 13F, 13D/G XML securities custodied. It can be customized output based upon selected accounts and accounts for the delineation of key matters such as voting rights. This tooling is available from other commonly used technology and counterparty platforms, such as custody, administration, and OMS/PMS systems. Given we do not file Form 13F, we asked several peer managers who do, including recent first-time filers. They cited 1-2 hours of time associated with the filing and $250, each. These figures are presented with an abundance of caution according to one, and this anecdotal data is contrary to the SECs estimation of cost. 9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? For institutional investors (LPs) who allocate capital to firms that do not readily provide transparency, 13F acts as a form of monitoring and diligence, improving the working dialogue between principal (LP) and agent (investment manager, or GP), especially with smaller firms. The range of such monitoring and diligence can include improving alignment between the two parties, ensuring IPS compliance, all the way to avoiding / surfacing fraud. An additionally ancillary benefit is the sourcing of investment talent, which can be done by proxy through Form 13F transparency. Regarding corporates, the increased transparency regarding ones shareholder base is an important tool for ensuring the healthy maintenance of corporate governance, and acts as a leveling playing field versus the expensive acquisition of corporate surveillance services. This is especially the case across smaller and mid-capitalization securities where there is a disproportionate percentage of ownership across what would be non-obliged filers.For investment managers seeking to effectuate change due to perceived corporate governance issues, the ability to know the identity of peer shareholders is important in catalyzing such change when other forms of disclosure (e.g., 13D/G) are not accessible. Finally, for academics who perform research on otherwise non-transparent market actors, the benefit to access Form 13F is in being able to form a more complete picture of the activities and ownership patterns of active managers. This benefits all members of the ecosystem.10. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to larger managers? If so, how? Is it beneficial to the markets to continue to have access to Form 13F data from larger managers? If so, why? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? We do not believe so. We believe the regulatory costs associated with Form 13F are de minimis for large managers and already overstated by SEC. The benefit for larger managers is in the ability for the surfacing of their portfolio positions to provide information to the market. The most emblematic case of this is with activist managers who publicize their positions vocally, adding information to capital markets (see Brav et al., 2008, Journal of Finance). This information is beneficial to not only the investment manager but the beneficial owner of the securities through improved price discovery. 11. Who uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and fewer filers report? Do those users prefer a different threshold? Why or why not? Can those users reasonably find alternative sources of data that meet their needs? Why or why not? The entire market ecosystem leverages Form 13F, most notably LPs and corporates. GPs also use it (having worked with dozens of hedge funds who consume 13F analysis, we can attest to this). The proposed change of threshold limits the ancillary benefit of increased market transparency into the behavior of non-transparent market actors. 12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? How do the costs differ for larger and smaller managers? How much internal time do managers devote to compliance with Form 13F? What are the external costs, such as the cost of a third-party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? We request comment on the direct compliance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13F, including the estimates in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers. We believe these estimates are inaccurate for most investment management firms, specifically single strategy or single-vehicle private partnerships. The export of ones eligible holdings data into a 13F XML format is a commoditized function in 2020. It requires minimal investment of time, experience, or expertise, especially for a firm accustomed to filing. Where costs may be more onerous include financial advisors or other registered investment advisors that have numerous client accounts with disparate custodial relationships. Even still, aggregation of holdings should already be a basic obligation of sensible portfolio and risk management 13. We also request comment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect costs, such as the potential for front-running and copycatting. Do commenters agree that these indirect costs are incurred? How do these indirect costs differ for larger and smaller managers? Are there other or different indirect costs that are incurred in connection with Form 13F? What are those and how would they be affected by the proposed amendments? We believe front-running costs are not a sensible fear, as 13Fs are representative of position holdings as of a 45-day lag. How can someone reading stale information front run an investment manager? Regarding copycatting, investment managers who fear their intellectual property can be copied are in fact symbiotically aided by those that carry out such a strategy. This is because said investment managers can anticipate a bid associated with the disclosure of their portfolio holdings. This is analogous to the common practice of activist investors who publicize their positions and often position their exposure around the disclosure of said information (e.g., through short-dated derivatives). This dynamic is clearly explained through academic research (see Hirshliefer, Subrahmanyan, et al. 1994, Journal of Finance). Such an equilibrium provides a capital markets information advantage for said managers. Or as the authors say, investors who discover information early trade aggressively in the initial period and then partially reverse their trades in the next trading round, when the trades of the investors who become informed at this later date cause the price to more fully reflect the investors' information. This benefits GPs and their beneficial owners. 14. Rather than the staff conducting periodic reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold, should we instead adopt a periodic automatic adjustment to the Form 13F reporting threshold? If so, how often should the reporting threshold be automatically adjusted? If we adopt an automatic adjustment, what measure should we use to make the adjustment? Should we use consumer price inflation measures such as the CPI or PCE? Should we use stock market growth or stock market returns instead? Is there a different measure that would be more appropriate? If so, please explain why. If we use any of these measures, how should they be measured and as of what date? If we use an adjustment based on stock market growth or returns, the adjustment could be positive or negative compared with the present level. Would such an automatic adjustment raise any additional issues that the Commission should take into account in considering such an automatic adjustment? The choice behind an automatic adjustment should be founded upon the implied benefit from altering the filing requirement, which we believe is invalid. It is our belief that additional transparency adds efficiency to capital markets, rendering a systematic recalibration a moot point. Like any technology cost function, the cost associated with the regulatory burden will only decline over time due to data extraction technologies and automation. It is in fact our contention that such costs have already flattened tremendously, and that SECs analysis is blind to this fact. As such, this seems to be a non sequitur. 15. Should we, as proposed, eliminate the omission threshold? Why or why not? Given the ease for transmitting holdings electronically, eliminating the omission threshold only makes the filing of 13F easier as there is one less step between the execution and transmission of the extract, as it pertains to review with ones existing portfolio. 16. If the Form 13F reporting threshold is raised to $3.5 billion as proposed, to the extent it is not already reported on a voluntary basis, would investors and the markets find the disclosure of smaller holdings information for larger managers valuable? Why or why not? We disagree with the premise. 17. Among Form 13F filers with at least $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities under management, is it costly to report small positions? Why or why not? How many of these filers positions have fewer than 10,000 shares? How many of their positions are valued under $200,000? What is the incremental cost of reporting these small positions on Form 13F? Is the incremental cost significant? Are there other costs associated with identifying these specific positions for purposes of excluding them? Are there other reasons that it would be beneficial to keep the omission threshold? N/A 18. Rather than eliminating the omission threshold, should we increase it? If so, what part should we increase? Should we adjust only the share limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust only the value limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust both components of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we, for example, increase the share limit to 50,000 and the value limit to $1,000,000? We disagree with increasing the omission threshold, as it only adds confusion to a straightforward extraction process and doesnt protect intellectual property. 19. Should we mirror the adjustment to the omission threshold proportionately to the adjustment we are proposing for the Form 13F reporting threshold using stock market growth? Would such an adjustment result in a significant decrease in securities reported on Form 13F? Would such an adjustment impede the ability of the public to observe the impact managers have on the markets? Doing such would arbitrarily harm transparency with limited to no benefit. 20. If we maintain an omission threshold, should we adopt a mechanism for automatic future adjustments of the omission threshold? Should future adjustments be for the share limit, for the value limit, or for both? What is an appropriate mechanism for adjusting the share limit? We disagree with the premise. 21. Should we require managers to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F? We believe this is a strong benefit. This allows market participants attempting to unravel convoluted ownership structures and crosslink CIK with CRD, to do so without liberal assumptions. 22. Should we require managers to provide the CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, of other managers identified in their 13F report? We believe so. 23. Would this additional identifying on Form 13F be useful information? If so, how? Yes, because it allows for cleaner segmentation of 13F aggregate filings with structured information provided in Form ADV1. 24. Would disclosing this information be unduly burdensome for 13F filers? No, it would be rather trivial. 25. Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13Fs requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? We believe the current standard of security identification does an appropriate job of balancing unique security identification with the costs associated with a commercial provider of said identifiers. 26. Should we require filers to round all dollar values listed on Form 13F to the nearest dollar and remove the requirement to omit 000? Should we, alternatively, maintain the current rounding conventions? Should we adopt some other rounding conventions? Should we no longer permit rounding? We have no view on this matter. 27. Are there any other amendments we should make to streamline Form 13F or simplify its instructions? If so, what are they? There is currently an exclusion clause that allows an entity to avoid filing Form 13F if they do not use US Mail. There is anecdotal evidence of clever foreign asset owners who use this as a loophole to avoid filing. This should likely be addressed before it broadens into a larger problem. 28. Will our proposed technical amendments increase the accuracy of Form 13F data? We have no view on this matter. 29. Will our proposed technical amendments make Form 13F data easier to understand and more accessible to the public? We have no view on this matter. 30. Would these proposed technical amendments impose costs or burdens on filers? We do not believe so. 31. Does the amendment appropriately reflect the effect of the U.S. Supreme Courts June 24, 2019, decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media on the type of information that is required to substantiate confidential treatment in accordance with Exchange Act sections 13(f)(4) and (5) and rule 24b-2 thereunder? We have no view on this matter. 32. Would relieving smaller managers from the compliance burdens of Form 13F reduce costs and enhance competition and add efficiency, including enhancing the ability of smaller managers to compete in the market? To what extent, if any, would the benefits be passed on to investors in the form of lower management fees and/or enhanced services? Would the proposed increase in the Form 13F threshold protect smaller managers from harmful behaviors such as front-running? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers promote capital formation by encouraging these managers to invest more in small and mid-size portfolio companies? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers benefit investors? The net cost of such a change will not add efficiency to the market. One could argue that management fees will to the contrary increase, as investment managers (acting as agents) will have more bargaining leverage against institutional allocators (acting as principals) once transparency is harmed. There is ample evidence of such in principal/agent research. We do not understand how obviating a Form 13F filing will protect an investor from front-running given the inherent lag associated with the filing. 33. Would the proposed technical amendments increase efficiency by enhancing the accuracy of Form 13F data? Are the cost estimates appropriate?We have no view on this matter. 34. Would the proposed additional identifying information increase efficiency by making it easier to identify a Form 13F filers other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over 13(f) securities? Providing a systematic mapping between CIK and CRD is a positive step in providing transparency between the interrelationships between filing entities and registered investment advisors."

Email Transmission to: rule-comments@sec.gov To: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Date: 21 July 2020 Re: File Number S7-08-20 - In Opposition to 13F Reporting Proposal As asset allocators for non-institutional investors, we are alarmed at the prospect of curtailing 13Fs reporting responsibilities by exempting funds of under $3.5 Billion in AUM. Here are the reasons why we, as well as other asset allocators, rely heavily upon 13F reports: 1. It enables investors to drill down and see holdings of any manager of a portfolio larger than $100 million dollars. This is a crucial tool for us in evaluating the investment style of the manager, its concentrations in different sectors of the economy, any style drift, and to determine ownership overlap of the same names among funds. Such information and transparency can nurture confidence in smaller managers and is critically important in striving for prudent diversification, avoiding huge concentrations in a few popular stocks that are simultaneously owned by multiple managers. 2. The contention that this curtailment will lead to lower costs for smaller managers is a “red herring.” In fact, transaction costs for smaller managers will probably increase, not decrease. Why? Virtually every hedge fund investor in their due diligence process requires to see composition and holding of the funds. Without readily available 13F reporting, those small hedge funds will have to face and answer duplicative inquiries from potential/existing investors on a daily basis. Compilation efforts for 13F reporting is rather minimal with the reporting task, really not consuming more than a few hours of time on a quarterly basis. Without this type of disclosure, one can predict with a high degree of certainty that the smaller managers will face a much harder time of raising capital because their blind pools will deter allocations. We understand that one of the principal arguments of the SEC in proposing this change is to “reflect proportionately the same market value of U.S. PETER KIMMELMAN ASSET MANAGEMENT L. L. C . 2 equities that $100 million dollars represented in 1975.” How curious – if not, absurd – to fashion regulations to an environment of 45 years ago. The markets are very, very different today. 3. To summarize: Rather than attempting – erroneously – to save money on regulatory compliance for the smaller manager, this concept represents totally erroneous thinking. We urge the SEC to drop this proposal and to continue to require reporting requirements of all managers of over $100MM of their underlying portfolios."

"Michael A. Perlow, Partner / CTO, Epsilon Asset Management",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7455221-221033.htm,,"July 21, 2020 We are respectfully submitting our comments against the central proposed change set forth in S7-08-20, Release No. 34-89290. This refers to the change in filing threshold proposed by the SEC for holders of 13F securities. It is our humble contention that the cost/benefit analysis presented by SEC for said change misses the mark on both sides of the equation.In our view, SECs focus was aimed at providing regulatory relief to smaller asset managers, which on its face is welcome. However, it is our contention that it does an incomplete job of accurately reflecting the de minimis cost associated with said filing.It is our belief that the methodology presented in the proposal to estimate cost is inflated and hard to reconcile with tangible experience. Our belief was already articulated by SEC Commissioner Lee in her public retort (July 10, 2020) to said proposal. As Commissioner Lee so eloquently described, SECs estimation of per manager cost associated with 13F filing represents a nearly 400% cost inflation versus their prior robust analysis, conducted less than 2 years ago. This is a curious development.Furthermore, it contradicts a reasonable expectation of cost deflation associated with an easily automatable task. Such automations need not be the job of the investment manager and have been made readily available by numerous counterparties (e.g., brokers, custodians, administrators), largely for free. These innovations have only accelerated in recent years since the SECs migration to XML filing for Form 13F in 2013.Given our belief that the task of generating a Form 13F is both simple and easily rules based, it is reasonable to expect this filing cost to follow most commodity-function cost curves. This is our central point of disagreement with the purported cost-benefit of regulatory relief.Far more importantly, the diminished transparency proposed by SEC levies a huge cost that is bizarrely unaccounted for in the proposal. It is our central contention that SEC did not adequately address the costs borne by various members of the domestic equity capital market ecosystem. Principally, institutional investors (LPs), corporates, academics, and the public writ large will be harmed by this change. To summarize each:Direct Harm to LPs and academics- The proposed change damages the LP community, which uses 13F transparency as a tool for oversight and diligence for non-transparent managers- The proposed change damages the LP and academic community by eliminating an analytical lens of aggregate hedge fund manager behavior across US equities, for which there is no ready substituteIndirect Harm to Capital Markets (GPs and Corporates)- the proposed change damages capital market efficiency, notably for small and mid-sized corporates – which on average have more active ownership and rely on 13Fs for visibility into their own shareholder base- the proposed change damages active managers who benefit from coordinating with other shareholders to improve corporate governance habits through their shareholder rightsGiven an incomplete analysis of both purported savings and added costs, we are respectfully but vehemently against the heart of the proposal.There are several other minor changes proposed by SEC, to which we provide comments and feedback in our itemized responses to their questions. To summarize, these ancillary changes are net beneficial.Respectfully,Michael Perlow Faryan Amir-Ghassemi - Epsilon Asset Management---1. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1? Is the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion appropriate? If another threshold would be more appropriate, what should the threshold be and why?It is our belief that an upward adjustment for the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1 has significant costs associated with it, as it pertains to the transparency afforded to institutional investors, as well as publicly traded corporates. When these costs are appropriately accounted for, the value of an upward adjustment is quite bleak.We further believe the reporting burden as purported by SEC is vastly inflated given the plethora of technological tools available to simply export a list of long equity holdings through XML. As such, the decision behind a threshold increase seems specious at best.2. Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(f) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? If so, how? And if so, is there a different threshold that would be more appropriate? Are there any additional effects of raising the Form 13F reporting threshold that we have not considered?It is our firm belief that raising the threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion will negative affect the utility of the data as well as investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. Markets. We believe so for several reasons:- Investors (namely qualified purchasers) of non-transparent investment firms (namely private partnerships) will lose a key form of oversight as to the investment activities of these firms. This will damage the LP community which uses this information source to strength the principal / agent relationship between GPs and LPs.- While it is true that (as of 12/31/2018), 90.8 percent of the dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data would be retained with this proposal, the vast majority of that dollar value would be associated with passive investment firms, for which the transparency provides relatively limited value compared to that of active private partnerships.- The majority of dollar value transparency lost will come from active participation in US securities, which act as marginal price-setters of securities. This will have an amplified impact in terms of reducing shareholder and corporate transparency.- If there is value in this information in lowering the cost of capital formation and improving the functioning of capital markets (it is our contention that there is), this will damage those positive benefits.- Given the disproportionate participation of active owners in smaller and mid capitalization securities, it will also disproportionately harm those portions of the market.3. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Boards flow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis for this calculation?Anchoring a change in threshold to the growth in U.S. equities is not (in our opinion) an appropriate gauge. This is because the nature of complexion of U.S. capital markets have changed tremendously over the last 4 decades, namely through the rise of intermediaries that act as agents on behalf of an increasingly larger institutional ownership base of U.S. equities. If anything, given the increased importance of the financial sector as a function of the US economy, greater regulatory oversight of these intermediaries could be argued.4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively reflect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? For example, under this approach, we could take the market size as of the end of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, average those values, and compare that average to the size of the U.S. equities market in 1975. If so, why? Is such a five-year period (or other period) more appropriate for calculating an average growth rate to apply over the 45 years since the threshold was initially set?We are against such a metric, for the reasons above (e.g., response #3), but also because such a drastic change would adversely impact the expanded benefit of 13F disclosure, causing a net cost to the aggregate ecosystem.5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis for this calculation? If so, how should we measure stock market returns? For example, would dividends be included or excluded? Is there another measure that we should use as a basis for initially adjusting the reporting threshold?See #4.6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F to account for consumer price inflation? If so, what measure of consumer price inflation—PCE or CPI—should we use? Is there another measure of consumer price inflation (or other inflation measure) that we should use? If so, what?See #47. Should we adopt a different rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3.6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a different rounding convention, why?We have no perspective on this matter.8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers?We personally do not believe so, given the accumulation of ones exposures is manifold to basic portfolio and risk management for a registered investment adviser. The exporting of such data to the SEC through EDGAR has become trivially easy due to technological integration. For example, Epsilons brokerage platform affords for easy and free export of Form 13F, 13D/G XML securities custodied. It can be customized output based upon selected accounts and accounts for the delineation of key matters such as voting rights.This tooling is available from other commonly used technology and counterparty platforms, such as custody, administration, and OMS/PMS systems. Given we do not file Form 13F, we asked several peer managers who do, including recent first-time filers. They cited 1-2 hours of time associated with the filing and $250, each. These figures are presented with an abundance of caution according to one, and this anecdotal data is contrary to the SECs estimation of cost.9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why?For institutional investors (LPs) who allocate capital to firms that do not readily provide transparency, 13F acts as a form of monitoring and diligence, improving the working dialogue between principal (LP) and agent (investment manager, or GP), especially with smaller firms. The range of such monitoring and diligence can include improving alignment between the two parties, ensuring IPS compliance, all the way to avoiding / surfacing fraud. An additionally ancillary benefit is the sourcing of investment talent, which can be done by proxy through Form 13F transparency.Regarding corporates, the increased transparency regarding ones shareholder base is an important tool for ensuring the healthy maintenance of corporate governance, and acts as a leveling playing field versus the expensive acquisition of corporate surveillance services. This is especially the case across smaller and mid-capitalization securities where there is a disproportionate percentage of ownership across what would be non- obliged filers.For investment managers seeking to effectuate change due to perceived corporate governance issues, the ability to know the identity of peer shareholders is important in catalyzing such change when other forms of disclosure (e.g., 13D/G) are not accessible.Finally, for academics who perform research on otherwise non-transparent market actors, the benefit to access Form 13F is in being able to form a more complete picture of the activities and ownership patterns of active managers. This benefits all members of the ecosystem.10. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to larger managers? If so, how? Is it beneficial to the markets to continue to have access to Form 13F data from larger managers? If so, why? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why?We do not believe so. We believe the regulatory costs associated with Form 13F are de minimis for large managers and already overstated by SEC. The benefit for larger managers is in the ability for the surfacing of their portfolio positions to provide information to the market. The most emblematic case of this is with activist managers who publicize their positions vocally, adding information to capital markets (see Brav et al., 2008, Journal of Finance). This information is beneficial to not only the investment manager but the beneficial owner of the securities through improved price discovery.11. Who uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and fewer filers report? Do those users prefer a different threshold? Why or why not? Can those users reasonably find alternative sources of data that meet their needs? Why or why not?The entire market ecosystem leverages Form 13F, most notably LPs and corporates. GPs also use it (having worked with dozens of hedge funds who consume 13F analysis, we can attest to this). The proposed change of threshold limits the ancillary benefit of increased market transparency into the behavior of non-transparent market actors.12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? How do the costs differ for larger and smaller managers? How much internal time do managers devote to compliance with Form 13F? What are the external costs, such as the cost of a third-party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? We request comment on the direct compliance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13F, including the estimates in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers.We believe these estimates are inaccurate for most investment management firms, specifically single strategy or single-vehicle private partnerships. The export of ones eligible holdings data into a 13F XML format is a commoditized function in 2020. It requires minimal investment of time, experience, or expertise, especially for a firm accustomed to filing.Where costs may be more onerous include financial advisors or other registered investment advisors that have numerous client accounts with disparate custodial relationships. Even still, aggregation of holdings should already be a basic obligation of sensible portfolio and risk management13. We also request comment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect costs, such as the potential for front-running and copycatting. Do commenters agree that these indirect costs are incurred? How do these indirect costs differ for larger and smaller managers? Are there other or different indirect costs that are incurred in connection with Form 13F? What are those and how would they be affected by the proposed amendments?We believe front-running costs are not a sensible fear, as 13Fs are representative of position holdings as of a 45-day lag. How can someone reading stale information front run an investment manager?Regarding copycatting, investment managers who fear their intellectual property can be copied are in fact symbiotically aided by those that carry out such a strategy. This is because said investment managers can anticipate a bid associated with the disclosure of their portfolio holdings. This is analogous to the common practice of activist investors who publicize their positions and often position their exposure around the disclosure of said information (e.g., through short-dated derivatives).This dynamic is clearly explained through academic research (see Hirshliefer, Subrahmanyan, et al. 1994, Journal of Finance). Such an equilibrium provides a capital markets information advantage for said managers. Or as the authors say, investors who discover information early trade aggressively in the initial period and then partially reverse their trades in the next trading round, when the trades of the investors who become informed at this later date cause the price to more fully reflect the investors' information. This benefits GPs and their beneficial owners.14. Rather than the staff conducting periodic reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold, should we instead adopt a periodic automatic adjustment to the Form 13F reporting threshold? If so, how often should the reporting threshold be automatically adjusted? If we adopt an automatic adjustment, what measure should we use to make the adjustment? Should we use consumer price inflation measures such as the CPI or PCE? Should we use stock market growth or stock market returns instead? Is there a different measure that would be more appropriate? If so, please explain why. If we use any of these measures, how should they be measured and as of what date? If we use an adjustment based on stock market growth or returns, the adjustment could be positive or negative compared with the present level. Would such an automatic adjustment raise any additional issues that the Commission should take into account in considering such an automatic adjustment?The choice behind an automatic adjustment should be founded upon the implied benefit from altering the filing requirement, which we believe is invalid. It is our belief that additional transparency adds efficiency to capital markets, rendering a systematic recalibration a moot point.Like any technology cost function, the cost associated with the regulatory burden will only decline over time due to data extraction technologies and automation. It is in fact our contention that such costs have already flattened tremendously, and that SECs analysis is blind to this fact. As such, this seems to be a non sequitur.15. Should we, as proposed, eliminate the omission threshold? Why or why not?Given the ease for transmitting holdings electronically, eliminating the omission threshold only makes the filing of 13F easier as there is one less step between the execution and transmission of the extract, as it pertains to review with ones existing portfolio.16. If the Form 13F reporting threshold is raised to $3.5 billion as proposed, to the extent it is not already reported on a voluntary basis, would investors and the markets find the disclosure of smaller holdings information for larger managers valuable? Why or why not?We disagree with the premise.17. Among Form 13F filers with at least $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities under management, is it costly to report small positions? Why or why not? How many of these filers positions have fewer than 10,000 shares? How many of their positions are valued under $200,000? What is the incremental cost of reporting these small positions on Form 13F? Is the incremental cost significant? Are there other costs associated with identifying these specific positions for purposes of excluding them? Are there other reasons that it would be beneficial to keep the omission threshold?N/A18. Rather than eliminating the omission threshold, should we increase it? If so, what part should we increase? Should we adjust only the share limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust only the value limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust both components of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we, for example, increase the share limit to 50,000 and the value limit to $1,000,000?We disagree with increasing the omission threshold, as it only adds confusion to a straightforward extraction process and doesnt protect intellectual property.19. Should we mirror the adjustment to the omission threshold proportionately to the adjustment we are proposing for the Form 13F reporting threshold using stock market growth? Would such an adjustment result in a significant decrease in securities reported on Form 13F? Would such an adjustment impede the ability of the public to observe the impact managers have on the markets?Doing such would arbitrarily harm transparency with limited to no benefit.20. If we maintain an omission threshold, should we adopt a mechanism for automatic future adjustments of the omission threshold? Should future adjustments be for the share limit, for the value limit, or for both? What is an appropriate mechanism for adjusting the share limit?We disagree with the premise.21. Should we require managers to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F?We believe this is a strong benefit. This allows market participants attempting to unravel convoluted ownership structures and crosslink CIK with CRD, to do so without liberal assumptions.22. Should we require managers to provide the CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, of other managers identified in their 13F report?We believe so.23. Would this additional identifying on Form 13F be useful information? If so, how?Yes, because it allows for cleaner segmentation of 13F aggregate filings with structured information provided in Form ADV1.24. Would disclosing this information be unduly burdensome for 13F filers? No, it would be rather trivial.25. Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13Fs requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data?We believe the current standard of security identification does an appropriate job of balancing unique security identification with the costs associated with a commercial provider of said identifiers.26. Should we require filers to round all dollar values listed on Form 13F to the nearest dollar and remove the requirement to omit 000? Should we, alternatively, maintain the current rounding conventions? Should we adopt some other rounding conventions? Should we no longer permit rounding?We have no view on this matter.27. Are there any other amendments we should make to streamline Form 13F or simplify its instructions? If so, what are they?There is currently an exclusion clause that allows an entity to avoid filing Form 13F if they do not use US Mail. There is anecdotal evidence of clever foreign asset owners who use this as a loophole to avoid filing. This should likely be addressed before it broadens into a larger problem.28. Will our proposed technical amendments increase the accuracy of Form 13F data?We have no view on this matter.29. Will our proposed technical amendments make Form 13F data easier to understand and more accessible to the public?We have no view on this matter.30. Would these proposed technical amendments impose costs or burdens on filers?We do not believe so.31. Does the amendment appropriately reflect the effect of the U.S. Supreme Courts June 24, 2019, decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media on the type of information that is required to substantiate confidential treatment in accordance with Exchange Act sections 13(f)(4) and (5) and rule 24b-2 thereunder?We have no view on this matter.32. Would relieving smaller managers from the compliance burdens of Form 13F reduce costs and enhance competition and add efficiency, including enhancing the ability of smaller managers to compete in the market? To what extent, if any, would the benefits be passed on to investors in the form of lower management fees and/or enhanced services? Would the proposed increase in the Form 13F threshold protect smaller managers from harmful behaviors such as front-running? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers promote capital formation by encouraging these managers to invest more in small and mid-size portfolio companies? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers benefit investors?The net cost of such a change will not add efficiency to the market. One could argue that management fees will to the contrary increase, as investment managers (acting as agents) will have more bargaining leverage against institutional allocators (acting as principals) once transparency is harmed. There is ample evidence of such in principal/agent research. We do not understand how obviating a Form 13F filing will protect an investor from front-running given the inherent lag associated with the filing.33. Would the proposed technical amendments increase efficiency by enhancing the accuracy of Form 13F data? Are the cost estimates appropriate?We have no view on this matter.34. Would the proposed additional identifying information increase efficiency by making it easier to identify a Form 13F filers other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over 13(f) securities?Providing a systematic mapping between CIK and CRD is a positive step in providing transparency between the interrelationships between filing entities and registered investment advisors."

As such, please do not move ahead with this proposal, or at the very least consider significantly lowering the threshold. Here are some of the points that I believe are pertinent: - SEC has fairness among its values which says that The SEC treats investors, market participants, and others fairly and in accordance with the law. This proposal is unfair to smaller/retail investors who will be at an increased informational disadvantage on a playing field that is already not level. - SEC has strategic goal 3 to Facilitate access to the information investors need to make informed investment decisions. The proposal goes counter to facilitating this access to all investors including retail investors. - SEC's vision inlcudes Protection against fraud and abuse. The proposal may impair this vision as less requirements of reporting may lead to more opportunities of fraud and abuse by some market participants, as there will be less information on the hands of SEC to hold certain parties accountable when needed. - SEC's vision includes Promotion of disclosure of market-related information and Transparent disclosure to investors of the risks of particular investments. The proposal runs counter to this vision. Understanding who the shareholders are provides important information to both current and prospective shareholders of the company and also helps the public companies better understand who their shareholders are. Due to lack of a substantial (90%) portion of the disclosure, the proposal also impairs another of SEC's visions which is Focus on strengthening market structure and systems. - The proposal also limits future academic research on markets. Academic research has an important benefit of shedding light into insights that are otherwise not accessible. Closing the opportunity to gaining such insights will impair SEC's vision to Focus on strengthening market structure and systems. Overall, the proposal runs counter to SEC's values, vision and goals, and also counter to the American spirit of fairness, equality, transparency, opportunity, dynamism, and academic progress, i.e. in essence everything that makes America great. While I believe that the proposal should be dropped, in the event it has to go through I think an inflation adjusted figure of $490 million threshold is far more appropriate than $3.5 billion.

"Vinesh Jha, Ceo, Extractalpha",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7441709-220928.htm,,"July 19, 2020 Dear SEC, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule change for holdings disclosures regarding form 13F. By way of background, I am the founder and CEO of a financial technology firm called ExtractAlpha, whose clients, including the largest and most sophisticated investment management firms, rely on our data and research for their data-driven decision making and I have been at the forefront of data-related issues in trading, investment management, and finance research for over twenty years. I was formerly head of research for StarMine, a company which provided accountability in equity research in the wake of the equity research scandals of the early 2000s. StarMine was acquired by Reuters in 2009. I have also spend considerable time as a trader and portfolio manager within banks and hedge funds. My current firm focuses on helping investors use data and disclosures to make better decisions, thereby making market prices more efficient and fair. We strongly believe that the availability of high quality, abundant data is an unqualified good for the markets, and we believe that our decades of investment research proves this to be the case. We believe that there are two competing views which many of us in the capital markets space hold dear, and which should not be particularly controversial: 1. Unnecessary regulatory disclosure burdens are bad for business from a cost perspective2. More disclosure is good for market efficiency There is a third view which might be more controversial, and where market participants probably have more varied views: 3. Regulatory disclosure burdens are bad for the investment management business from a proprietary information perspective These three are not always easy to reconcile, and the new 13F rules put them at direct odds with one another. Therefore, we must look at the particulars of the newly proposed rule changes and determine how the costs and benefits related to each view offset one another. First, to what degree are the current regulatory burdens bad for business? Second, to what degree are the existing disclosures good for the market, and how much would the newly proposed disclosures be worse? And third, to what degree does the current level of required disclosure affect business for asset managers?Of the three, the first question is actually the easiest to answer empirically, in the sense that the costs are quantifiable. We have spoken to multiple contacts in the industry to determine the magnitude of these costs. Typical responses: Its not a time-consuming task to prepare and file the report via EDGAR. Our 13F table is generated automatically. I spend less than 2 hours a quarter reviewing, editing, record keeping etc. We use a service to file. The fee is only $125 per quarter. They modify our report to comply with the EDGAR filing requirements and file it with the SEC. Its very efficient. We have not seen any estimates which are even close in magnitude to the PRA estimates listed in Table 2 of the text of the rule change, which seem orders of magnitude too large. Given the important role that reporting plays in investor protections, investment managers have built robust compliance organizations into their practice. Leveraging the capabilities of these fixed costs with an additional 2 hours of work per quarter, at a minimal cost, is an extremely efficient way to bring transparency to all market participants, and is in the best interest of everyone, including the managers own clients. There are many onerous regulatory burdens in the asset management industry, many of which have emerged post-Madoff. 13F filings are not one of them and its unclear why today, in an era in which the general public understands the value of data and disclosure, a reduction in the availability of such information is on the table. As for the second question, are the disclosures good for the market? The data in 13F filings is highly valuable for financial researchers who analyze EDGAR data in order to gain insight into holdings, sentiment, and trends in the investment management industry. Investors can use the data to understand whether their managers have drifted from the style which they claim in their documents, or have recklessly invested in positions which are more speculative than their mandate would imply, or have become more or less concentrated in their holdings than an investor would have been led to believe. Although the data only tells a part of the story – for example, it shows only the long side of the managers holdings and not the short side – it is still immensely valuable. From an institutional investors perspective, the following quote sums up the viewpoint nicely: I am a lot more concerned about losing transparency from a research point of view than I am about filing As for the third question, are the disclosures bad for business for investment managers? Do they harm the ability of investment managers to do their job competitively? We would argue that the original framing of the disclosure rules was actually forward-thinking in this regard. Trading today happens more and more rapidly, and investors holding periods has measurably shrunk over time. The disclosures are required only quarterly, and with a 45 day lag. By the time the holdings are disclosed, the fund has likely entered into its position, and anyone wishing to mimic the funds position can do so without adversely impacting the funds ability to enter that position at a favorable price without moving the market against it. The disclosures allow individual investors to examine an investment managers track record, without impacting that managers ability to do their job. It is rare, and commendable, that the Commission seeks to help reducing the regulatory burdens which have had a significantly negative impact on American capital markets since 2008. However, we believe on balance that the proposed amendments to 13F filings are a poor place to start, and wonder whether there is any single important interest group, including individual investors, for whom the proposed changes represent a truly significant improvement. On the whole, the balance of the arguments seems to clearly tilt in the favor of keeping the regulations as they are today. Adjusting the minimum AUM of filers would not benefit the investment managers, their clients, or the general public, would cause more harm than good, and should most certainly be considered a major rule change, with significant adverse effects on competition, investment and innovation, per the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.

I am an individual investor who uses 13F data regularly. It helps me get sense of who owns companies, who's buying and who's selling, both long-term holders and short-term traders. Current 13F reports particularly valuable for small-cap companies, where there is often little information available elsewhere. And many of the owners of these companies are small managers--those that would no longer be required to file under the proposed change. The effort required to file today's 13F reports is largely a click on they keyboard and not a significant burden to money managers, even small ones. In contrast, managers often see these reports as providing useful insight into firms. Its's always good to know what others are doing, both the geniuses and the fools. I applaud your desire to reduce excessive disclosure. But 13F information requires minimal cost and effort and helps make markets more transparent. I expect you will receive many comments along these lines, and I trust you will revise current proposal accordingly For the future, instead of cutting back on 13F disclosure, why not move to a 30-day deadline, instead of 45?

If a ceo or some other executive at a company is selling shares then I truly believe that should be open to the public. If it is not then this would make insider trading a lot easier to do. The current rule on disclosures helps to keep people and funds honest. There is no reason to increase the threshold for disclosures unless someone is trying to hide dubious activities."

Many limited partners, such as myself, use the filings as a way to discover active managers who invest their capital in ways that align with our investment objectives. With an increased reporting threshold, it will be more difficult and time consuming for us to find smaller active managers because we won't have a quick way to filter out those that don't suit our preferences and/or investment philosophy. This increase in search costs will likely be borne directly and indirectly by limited partners and will disadvantage smaller firms relative to their larger peers (who can afford to spend more resources on marketing/finding potential clients). In my view, time is the most precious resource that small investment firms have, and time spent on marketing detracts from time spent on investment research and, ultimately, from returns."

Generally speaking, enacting this rule will reduce transparency and lessen insight smaller investors will have when making investment decisions. Ultimately, the only acceptable change to the Reporting Threshold would be to lower this threshold further, not elevate the threshold - which any reasonable person could perceive as a slight to the small-time investor."

Time and time again we've seen that no profit-oriented corporation will do anything ""out of the goodness of their heart"", it is only through legal regulation that these corporations can be held in check.A loss of transparency of this magnitude will inevitably cause the SEC's workload to become a thousand times more, due to rampant market manipulation and insider trading done by firms holding 100's of millions in capital. For every firm that no longer is required to disclose, the only individuals who will benefit are the institutional investors who receive information through backdoor channels, the lobbyists who are getting paid by the corporations to further decrease transparency regulations, and the government officials who will almost certainly use their investment holdings in these companies to continue shaping government policy, increasing their personal profits and nepotism, at the expense of regular working-class citizens. I can't believe even the SEC is going so far backwards, but with how the rest of the Trump administration has aimed at ensuring all transparency throughout the government is eliminated, I can't say I am surprised by it.

Issuers had asked at a September 2019 summit with the SEC if 13F changes were in the plans as our community has long advocated for modernized data and shorter timeframes (Dodd-Frank directs the Commission to institute monthly short-reporting, a directive that remains tabled, even as the Commission now in surreal fashion moves to worsen transparency). We were told no, that our initiatives were not on the current administration’s set of objectives. And then we see this. We will offer a separate, formal comment letter, but the discussion here is both germane to central concerns about the proposal and comes with humor highlighting what to us is absurdity.

So tracking ownership-changes is hard. And unless we speak up it’s about to get a lot harder. In 1975 when the government was reeling like a balloon in the wind after cutting the dollar loose from its anchoring gold, Congress decided to grant itself a bunch of authority over the free stock market, turning into the system that it now is. How? Congress added Section 11A to the Securities Act, which in 2005 became Regulation National Market System governing stock-trading today – the reason why Market Structure Analytics, which we offer to both public companies and investors, are accurately predictive about short-term price-changes. And Congress decided to create a disclosure standard for investors, amending the Securities Act with section 13F. That’s what gave rise to the quarterly reports, 13Fs, that both investors and public companies rely on to know who owns shares. I use the phrase “rely on” loosely as the reports are filed 45 days after the end of each quarter, which means the positions could be totally different by the time data is released. It’s a standard fit for the post office. Mail was the means of mass communication in 1975. Currently, the standard applies to funds with $100 million or more in assets. Many managers divide assets into sub-funds to stay below that threshold. So most companies have shareholders that show up in no reports. But at least they have some idea. Well, out of the blue the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to lift the threshold to $3.5 billion to reflect, I guess, the collapse of dollar purchasing power. But nothing else changes! What would possess a regulatory body ostensibly responsible for promoting fairness and transparency to blanket the market in opacity while keeping in place time periods for reporting that have existed since 1975? I’m reminded of a great line from the most quotable movie in modern history, Thank You For Smoking: I cannot imagine a way in which you could have $#!!@ up more. Public companies have been asking the SEC for decades to modernize 13F reporting. Dodd Frank legislation passed in 2010 included a mandate for monthly short-position reporting. It’s not happened because the law put no timeframe on implementation. But how stupid would it be to require monthly short-position reporting while letting long positions remain undisclosed till 45 days after the end of each quarter? Much of the world has stricter standards of shareholder disclosure. Australian markets empower companies and stock exchanges to require of investors full disclosure of their economic interest, on demand. Our regulators appear to be going the opposite direction. Australia offers an idea, SEC. If you’re going darken the capital markets with a new (non) disclosure standard, then how about empowering companies to demand from holders at any time a full picture of what they own and how they own it? Investors, I get it. You don’t want anyone knowing what you have. Well, it seems to work just fine in Australia, home to a vibrant capital market. And let’s bring it around to market structure. There is a woefully tilted playing field around ETFs. A big investor, let’s say Vanguard, could give a billion-dollar basket of stocks to an Authorized Participant like Morgan Stanley off-market with no trading commissions and no taxes, in exchange for a billion dollars of ETF shares. None of that counts as fund-turnover. It could happen by 4p ET and be done the next day. No trading volume. And then Vanguard could come right back with the ETF shares – again, off-market, doesn’t count as fund-turnover – and receive the stocks back. Why would investors do that? To wash out capital gains. To profit on the changing prices of stocks and ETFs. This is a massive market – over $500 billion every month in US stocks alone. It’s already over $3 TRILLION in total this year. What’s wrong with it? All other investors have to actually buy and sell securities, and compete with other forces, and with volatility, and pay commissions, pay taxes, alter outcomes by tromping through supply and demand. Oh, and every single trade is handled by an intermediary (even if it’s a direct-access machine). So how is that fair? Well, couldn’t all investors do what Vanguard did? No. Retail investors cannot. Yes, big investors could take their stock-holdings to Morgan Stanley and do the same thing. But trading stocks and ETF shares back and forth to profit on price-changes while avoiding taxes and commissions isn’t long-term investment. That the ETF market enjoys such a radical advantage over everything else is a massive disservice to public companies and stock-pickers. And after approving the ETF market, you now, SEC, want to yank a blanket over shareholdings to boot? Really? Leave us in 1975 but 35 times worse? Market Structure Analytics will show you what’s happening anyway. And nearly in real time. But that’s not the point. The point is fairness and transparency. Every one of us should comment on this rule. # # # Yours Sincerely, Tim Quast President ModernNetworks IR LLC"

Walter H. H.,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7435085-220561.htm,,"July 16, 2020 This proposal is a fantastic idea. For too long, the burden on small asset managers has been too great. Often with small teams on tight budgets, it is a distraction away from the core duties of the asset manager, namely appropriately investing protecting client assets. The dissenting comments are likely to suggest it somehow unfair to not know what small managers are doing. As the proposal points out, in dollars, the vast majority of equity investments will still be accounted for. The unfairness argument gets to what is effectively a peak at the intellectual property of the individual asset manager. Do we require drug development companies to disclose what they're working on before they are prepared to announce it? No. This transparency to the public is a uniquely odd feature to the public equity investing world as a result of this dated dollar threshold that knows no similar requirement in any other aspect of investing let alone other business generally. Do we require distressed investors to disclose what loans they're buying? No. Do we require a construction company to disclose which projects it has won and what price it bid (effectively learnable using an average price each quarter with 13F?) Also no. Further, any investor relying on tea-leaf reading of other investors investments 45 days after-the-fact should probably stick to etf investing anyways. While they may not like it, the rule probably long run saves them from themselves. Some may argue companies in some way benefit by 'knowing who their shareholders are', but they can already obtain this information from their agent if they need it. Any material investors over 5% would still be captured by the additional filing requirements there. From a regulatory standpoint, the Commission and its brethren (FINRA et al) are already free to inquire into trading activities of asset managers as it wishes. No one loses with this proposal. Any losses are merely perceived by investors who had no business getting a look at this information anyways. Any manager who somehow thinks its a marketing tool is free to file a 13F at whatever level of AUM they see fit. Any investor in a small manager is likewise free to ask for whatever transparency they desire in a privately negotiated structure as you would expect in nearly any other investment vehicle in the world outside of public equities."

It will substantially reduce transparency. We need more transparency from all financial companies involved with the public, not less.2. One obvious reason is that the proposal, if implemented, is an open invitation for managers to run Ponzi schemes, because there would be no check available to the public whether they are truthfully reporting their investment returns, or just making them up.3. The 13F filing cost is miniscule for managers with all the data readily available in IT systems. I find the SEC's concern about filing costs rather disingenuous. The SEC estimates filing costs of $15,000 to $30,000 per year for a hedge fund which is the equivalent of about $0.30 for a person with a moderate income.4. It will not benefit the hedge funds either because investors will shun those funds for lack of disclosure reasons.5. I was under the impression that the SEC is chartered to make investing a level playing field for all investors. This proposal shows that the SEC does not take this mandate seriously."

Investors would have no idea that the companies they are investing in have shareholders holding these massive amounts of shares, which would easily allow rampant market manipulation from these shareholders without any investor knowledge or oversight. Transparency and the public availability of information are of the utmost importance in the stock market today, now more than ever.

However, this proposed filing is a direct contradiction to providing transparency. And for whom is this beneficial to? The wealthy class would prefer transparency of those who manage their wealth, the working class would prefer to see those with assets that require managers to behave similarly (although 100 million is a far-cry from average) vs managers who have to put assets they manage into ""preserving"" securities.

This change is extremely corrupt and it is honestly despicable this is even up for debate. My job consists of a ton of paperwork and filing for the government and do I like it? No, i really don't. But the filing I do is imperative that my company remains transparent and follows all rules and regulations. Inconvenience isn't an excuse to adjust the rules and regulations put in place. This is a part of their job and they have the duty to remain open and transparent. Optimizing or modernizing the method of how these managers get their data would be a smart move but raising the threshold which in turn takes away available data and transparency is taking one step forwards and fifty backwards. This benefits managers and hurts investors because filing the form is inconvenient. This will allow for managers to move behind the scenes while manipulating the market and increasing the corrupt methods they already practice while not reporting it. Please take in to consideration the whole picture and everyone involved and not just these managers. Going through with this exact proposal will lead to very negative consequences and this will not reflect well on the SEC. Transparency is on the line and I wouldn't want to go down in history as someone who opposes that and as someone who turned their back on smaller investors while these managers and their company's line their already filled pockets.

While I understand that as one small-time investor I’m relatively irrelevant to the stock exchange in the long run, what many people are failing to realize is the fact that with trading becoming readily available to anyone who’s interested through apps such as Webull and Robinhood, we make up a relatively decent amount of traders.

Considering how this pandemic/economic slowdown has affected most people, the new number of fund managers required to disclose holdings is drastically reduce the amount of public information out there that is crucial for people.

There is no evidence indicating that opacity in the financial realm benefits the economy. To the contrary, asymmetric information is well-established as a primary cause of financial misfortunes (as further demonstrated by the 2018 Nobel Laureates). Ample evidence indicates that such insularity of information translates into insularity of capital. Not only would this motion reduce information accessible to smaller investors (thereby reducing competition by proxy), but it would promote an environment in which low-quality debt and overvaluation thrive outside public scrutiny. Unfortunately, little has changed since the Great Recession in terms of risk aversion and debt consolidation, and arguments that only institutional players understand the economics of obscuring trillions of dollars to save approximately $30 million are elitist at best and in bad faith at worst.

One of the points in the proposal was that this rule would save those managers that $35k fee and save just over $100 mill per year in total. That's $100 mill saved on managers that collectively hold half a trillion dollars. I firmly believe that the manager who is responsible for $100 million dollars can afford a $35k annual fee to publicly disclose information, and should publicly disclose this information for the good of every investor managing under $100 million."

Using the most recent quarter as an example, the number of funds that would have to disclose their holdings to the public would fall from 5,283 to 549. Almost 90% of all filers. $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public stripping the people of transparency and valuable insight. Many investors choose to avoid over-owned stock due to the higher risk. This proposal would hamstring investors and their ability to be aware of, and to mitigate, their risk. This proposal would not only harm at-home investors, it would also negatively affect publicly traded companies by reducing their knowledge of who their shareholders are. Congress first adopted Section 13(f) in order to stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the US securities markets. Taking away the majority of this data flies in the face of the original intent of Section 13(f). Transparency gives investors confidence in US markets and this proposal would greatly reduce this confidence. If anything, you at the SEC should be pushing for increased transparency and disclosures not rolling back existing rules. This proposal holds no benefit for anyone other than the already bloated institutions and only serves to hurt small investors and hinder publicly traded businesses.

This action would obscure over $2 TRILLION in investment holdings and casts a large shadow over the small-to-micro-cap investments. In those markets, $3.5 billion in investments can mean tens of billions in shares which can cause massive swings in stock prices and be devastating to the individual investor. This action moves in the opposite direction of what should be the norm in financial markets - transparency and availability of key data. As someone who works daily with massive amounts of data, I have an appreciation for simplifying down to relevant data. However, just because a data set isn't 100% relevant 100% of the time doesn't mean it should be completely excluded or ignored. With modern technology, quantity of data is less of a problem because data management tools are available to reduce the burden of gathering, organizing and digesting data. The argument that the number of filers has increased from roughly 1000 in 1979 to roughly 5000 present day is a poor justification for increasing the threshold. The American population (per census data from 1980 and estimates for 2020) has increased by roughly 110 million people in the same time, so the number of filers should increase. Additionally, the increase in market value of publicly traded equities is a flawed argument. Based on the graph provided in the proposal on market value (pg. 11, Fig 2), the market value has increased roughly $20 trillion since 2006. This is heavily weighted by several of the top-valued companies in the US. For example, since 2006, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) combined represent approximately $3 trillion of that increase. That's just two companies! Add in several of the other largest cap companies and you'll quickly get to $10 trillion with just a handful of businesses. I urge you to strongly reconsider this proposal and decline enacting this policy. The detriment to the common investor will be vast and drive more of the large investment business into obscurity.

This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers. $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight. When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of the US securities markets. Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets. One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to this proposal. https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10The proposed rule change would be a loss for all of us - it would enable more corruption and opaqueness.

Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.#8203 - The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.- When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor- Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.- In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Institutional Investors share information within their professional networks, and by raising the reporting threshold, material information that affects the wider public marketplace becomes privileged, where it had not been for the preceding forty-five years. The overall burden of reporting the current threshold by Institutional Investors is negligible in light of already disproportionate resources at their disposal, and this only widens that resource gap. Rather than raising the threshold, the amount reported should be lowered to fifty-million dollars in the interests of democratizing the marketplace.

Stop signs are an inconvenience too...put they are there to protect EVERYONE from a car crash. Big or small car does not matter. It mitigates risk. Also adjusting the requirements to inflation since 1975 is questionable. A 100 million dollar fund is still a lot of money invested today and does not need to be adjusted. It’s a meaningless exercise. This could result in everyone leaving the funds under 3.5 billion from lack of transparency and going to funds that meet the 13-f requirement.

"Karl T. Muth, J.D., M.B.A., M.Phil., Ph.D.
Lecturer in Economics, Organizational Behavior, Public Policy, and Statistics, Northwestern University",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-220167.htm,,"Jul. 16, 2020 Dear Chair Clayton, the SEC Commissioners Several, and Those Considering the Rule, I comment today in support of the proposed Rule (the “Proposal”) described in Release 34-89290 (the “Document”). The periodic reporting requirements envisioned by Section 13(f) (the “Provision”) were drafted during the Ford administration as Wright Patman (D-TX) wrapped up his tenure as Chair of the pertinent House Committee (now the House Committee on Financial Services, then the House Committee on Banking and Currency). The vast majority of provisions drafted at that time and codified at 15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(1) and in nearby U.S. Code sections remain as they were in 1975. The Proposal changes the Provision to reflect the realities of today’s market where investment managers with $100M under management are commonplace. The SEC estimates roughly 4,500 of the 5,000 filers would be affected by the Proposal and would have their reporting burden under the original Provision meaningfully reduced. This is not only good for the reporting investment managers, it is good for the SEC, which can concentrate its limited audit and investigative resources at the right (no pun intended) end of the tail. The SEC stated earlier this month the new $3.5B threshold discussed in the Proposal is “proportionally the same market value of U.S. equities that $100 million represented in 1975.” While I agree with the gist of this, I believe it lacks some of the context needed. The number of 13F filers has increased dramatically since the Provision’s implementation. Figure 1 on p. 10 of the Document shows the number’s growth from approximately 600 filers to roughly 5,089 today, a 17x increase. Given the performance of equities markets over this period and the portion of high AUM managers who are equities-heavy relative to other asset classes, using an equities appreciation multiple seems reasonable; as the SEC notes in the Document, this results in a $3.57B threshold (compared with the $3.5B proposed threshold in the Proposal). It is also important to note $100M is simply not very relevant in the scheme of the U.S. economy. In 1975, US GDP (2020 dollars) was slightly less than $1.7T. Today, US GDP is nearly $22T (+1,294%). Turning to equities markets, the measure to which the SEC alludes on pp.15-16 of the Document, and no doubt the measure used matters, but in any event the amount of money referenced in the Provision (and implemented in nominal dollars, no less) in 1975 or 1979 is materially different today. Since the Provision took effect, the NASDAQ is up 10,311% and the DJIA is up 2,957%. Though $3.5B is an arbitrary cutoff, it has the intended and necessary effect of returning the number of filers burdened with this higher level of reporting to a number below 600 firms. While an increase of 3,000% or more in the minimum reporting threshold may seem like a large number, in this context it is not–in fact, only numbers this large are in the right order of magnitude. And implementing the Proposal continues a positive trend toward concentrating scrutiny and resources where they matter most (see also Release Nos. 33-10588; 34-84842) rather than attempting to monitor and police the market through an overbroad, dragnet approach. This Proposal also brings the US in line with other OECD countries reducing reporting requirements and improving compliance efficiency (see, e.g., the UK’s reconsideration of quarterly reporting in 2014). I write fully in support of the Proposal. While many have raised legitimate and thoughtful questions as to the implications of the Proposal, including SEC Commissioner Herren Lee, I do not believe these objections provide an alternate path forward; I have not seen objections that substantively challenge the appropriateness or effectiveness of a new reporting threshold or do more than merely citing that reporting will be reduced. I agree that reporting will be reduced, but suggest this is a virtue for the reasons stated above rather than a change that materially disadvantages investors or meaningfully reduces the information available to the markets the SEC oversees. These are my opinions and do not represent the views of my employer(s), client(s), or other institutions. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Karl T.

These filings are also used by individual investors and public companies to gain clarity on investment positions which are crucial to make informed decisions and keep asset allocations true to respective fund charters. This rule is unfortunately in principle opposed to the charter listed on SEC's own website. Further, the 30x increase in AUM limits is quite drastic and has a consequence of pushing a huge majority of institutional investors in the dark. It may encourage institutional investors to reduce/fragment portfolio sizes to go dark eventually resulting in reduced transparency and efficiency of markets.

Currently, institutional traders with account values over $100M must report their holdings on a quarterly basis. These filings submitted on from 13F. The SEC is proposing raising the 13F threshold to $3.5B. The SEC is proposing changing this rule because of what it sites as an administrative burden on smaller managers. To be clear, you are calling fund managers holding between $100M and $3.5B in assets under management ""small."" It is MY opinion as well as many others, that this is not so much about administration burden or costs. It is more about accountability and transparency. We believe there should be more transparency - not less. Events like the 2008 financial crisis resulted from a lack of transparency from banks and the effects of the crisis were devastating for many people all around the world By sending this message, I hope I can persuade you from changing the threshold from $100M to $3.5B in assets under management.

I believe, the threshold should remain to maintain the transparency and help prevent the occurrence of malicious actions by a firms directors to mislead investors. Permitting a decrease in your purview enables firms to conduct activities that are not in the best interests of their investors. These filings provide valuable transparency that otherwise would not be available to investors attempting to perform their own due diligence. As a commission tasked with the enforcement of securities in the United States, moving this threshold up acts in contrast with your stated mission.Unfortunately, while there is a cost associated with filing, this is the nature of having the privilege of managing investments, and is a completely justifiable and acceptable cost to provide. Regardless of the impact of the cost, the expenses are written off. I would be surprised to find that a investment house became insolvent due to costs associated with filing 13-Fs. Yes, they are a pain and a challenge to comply with, but that does not mean that the standard for compliance should be lessened. These filings bring transparency to the securities markets. While I do not have the resources of an institutional investor to perform a comprehensive review, even by your own standards on page 17, you indicate that this would lessen the reporting of firms by up to 90%. This also funnels retail and accredited investors into all but the largest investment firms. There are suitable options under the $3.5b mark, but moving the spotlight from those firms under that threshold would harm them by requiring accounts to move to less risky firms that have a greater element of transparency. A boon for the large investment firms already. Enabling the transparency of firm should not be dependent upon the size of their investments. These filings should be performed at all but the lowest levels, which by your chart is $100m. By increasing this limit you are also permitting firms to seek new avenues towards the mitigation of this reporting cap. This could lead to firms choosing to divest and perform other activities in order to sidestep this change. At $100m there is no benefit to attempting to avoid reporting. At $3.5b, theres a huge benefit. Do not enable companies to avoid standard reporting efforts. As an individual citizen, Im expected to report every dollar I earn to the IRS. Firms with $100m in assets should be held to at least the same standard with regards to their own filings.Please do what is right for individuals and institutions that rely on your enforcement of reporting activities to maintain transparency and mitigate an avenue for malfeasance by firms attempting to utilize a lessened reporting standard."

Instead, I suggest increasing the 13F reporting threshold to $1B or less. Points to consider: - Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number would severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. - Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number would reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are. Of note, this would be especially true for smaller market capitalization companies. - Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level and fair playing field, this rule change makes little sense. - In general, reducing transparency and access to data disadvantages smaller investors. - Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change would greatly reduce individual investors' ability to reduce this type of risk. - In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further. The SP 500 suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more."
Armin Drake,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7422646-219798.htm,,"July 15, 2020 Dear SEC,The proposed 13f reporting threshold rule change would greatly diminish transparency, especially for Main Street investors. By your own analysis, the number of current filers to be relieved would be 89.2%, more than 4,500 institutional investment managers would no longer report holdings. This would dramatically reduce transparency about discretionary accounts. Many Main Street investors would be at a disadvantage. If anything, the SEC should consider LOWERING the asset under management requirement to increase transparency of funds under $100 million. These funds have a fiduciary responsibility to their clients and investors. The current 13f filing requirement is one way Main Street investors can use the system as a check and balance against investment managers. 13fs are used to make sure the investment manager is abiding by their investment mandate and not taking advantage of limited partners. By allowing Main Street to see what their investment manager is buying and selling increases transparency and allows critical data to be shared. The SECs projected savings are so insufficient this part of the argument should be excluded. Most 13f filing requirements today are highly automated and dont cost investment managers much at all. Even assuming your analysis is correct, at the midpoint cost of roughly $20,000 on assets of $100,000,000, would equate to .02% cost. Other costs should be considered well before using 13f savings as a reason to increase AUM filing requirements. Regardless, the loss in transparency is much more detrimental. Regarding this topic, I think Commissioner Allison Herren Lee said it best:The release states a belief that the proposal will likely enhance competition by lowering the cost to participate in the market and benefit investors if such savings are passed through to investors. I support identifying ways to help smaller managers compete effectively, and to target their resources in ways that benefit investors. But, it is difficult to credit the possibility that the relatively small savings for this particular population of managers could advance either goal in any meaningful way. I, under no circumstances, support this proposed rule change. The cost savings are minimal (at best) and do not outweigh the large loss in transparency."

Our founders were senior leaders in the asset management industry and our research provides our clients with insights into various business risk that registered advisers face in carrying out their advisory services. We study the businesses of the 18,000 exempt and non-exempt filing advisers by examining the Form ADV, Form D and Schedule 13f. Our asset management clients use our data-driven insights to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their control environments and our retail and institutional investor clients use or insights to identify and manage operational risk. We are fortunate to serve many of the largest and most prominent firms in the industry. We continue to support the SECs mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation. In fact, we applaud the significant enhancements to Form ADV in October 2017. The additional disclosures that were added and the many enhancements and clarifications to form question provided additional transparency that helped small and large investors make more informed Adviser selection decisions. We do not believe that the current proposal to raise the 13f reporting threshold to $3.5bn is consistent with the SECs mission. In fact, it represents a significant step-backward. Less transparency and less data are never good for small and large investors. And 13f data is important. We cite the following reasons and strongly recommend materially reducing the proposed threshold. 1.Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities. Specifically, academic research around pricing, valuation, operating risk and adviser behaviors in bull and bear markets will be eliminated which will eliminate the type of transparency that is needed to study markets, behavior and eliminate the ability to find signals suggesting the potential for adviser wrongdoing. 2.Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about their shareholders. 3.Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will eliminate an investors ability to reconcile the positions reported to them in the quarterly performance reports and investment summaries given to them by their Advisers to positions reported in their 13F filings. 4.Many advisers work together informally to buy shares in companies they seek to influence. Investors need the ability to analyze positions across 13f filers of all sizes to identifying this form of investment ""smurfing."" These advisers have access to company management that small investors do not. This proposed rule change contradicts the SECs mission to protect investors. Less transparency and less data are never good for the small investor. 5.The cost justification for the rule change is highly questionable and actually encourages Advisers to spend even less on the internal processes, controls and technology they need to run their business in an orderly and well controlled manner. Advisers who invest properly in infrastructure have little to no problem producing and delivering 13f data and filings. In fact, in our studies of 13f filing accuracy, we clearly see differences between those Advisers who do and do not invest in the appropriate infrastructure. There is no size bias, meaning the regulatory filing requirements of small and large Advisers who invest in basic infrastructure is better than those that do not. Therefore, the 13f burdens cited are somewhat exaggerated. The cost of producing 13f data and related filings is only burdensome to Advisers who fail to invest enough to automate processes and who fail to work with Fund Administrators and other service providers who can help them reduce the cost of these processes. While the SEC's intent to relieve Advisers of unneeded cost burdens, 13f data is fundamental to its mission. 6.Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will rob individual investors of their ability to avoid over-owned stocks, what is referred to as crowded trades. Many contrarian investors use 13f data to manage investment risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce this risk. 7.In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting advisers would decline. Market volatility should not influence the number of filers. Thank you for your continued good work."

Kane Kalasr,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7418322-219607.htm,,"July 15, 2020 The purpose of Form 13F filing requires is to provide transparency and instill confidence in securities markets. Filings from a large number of institutional market participants is essential to meet this end. The rationale of the proposed rule change is twofold. First, a large percentage of the total assets tracked with 13F filings would continue to be tracked, and thus, the rule change would not materially alter whether or not the 13F filing requirement is serving its purpose. Second, the new proposed AUM requirement of 3.5 billion USD is approximately the inflation-adjusted value of the requirement when the requirement was first adopted. I will respond to each of these points separately. Tracking a significant number of assets via 13F filings is a necessary but not sufficient condition for instilling public confidence in securities markets. Imagine a hypothetical economy in which Berkshire Hathaway's trading was responsible for 10% of the total market value, for example. Now imagine that Form 13F was required to be filing only by Berkshire Hathaway. Despite the fact that 10% of publicly traded assets would be tracked in this situation, there are a number of problems related to insuring public confidence in securities markets, including but not limited to:1. As a result of it's size, it may be unfeasible for Berkshire Hathaway to invest in securities with small and medium sized market capitalizations. Having oversight of holdings in only large-cap securities is insufficient.2. Observing potential collusion between institutional money management firms would be impossible since data would only be required for 1 firm. While it is true that the proposed change would more accurately reflect the original intend of the Form 13F requirement, in 2020, more disclosure is needed in securities markets than was needed 40 years ago. The public has been particularly suspicious of finance and institutional money management since the 2007/2008 financial crisis. We should not be this quick to forget the ""Occupy"" movement which started in New York and spread quickly across the United States. In 2020, more information is publicly available in general there is a public expectation of transparency that was absent decades ago. Finally, concerns regarding collusion, market manipulation, and ""rigging the deck"" are at an all-time high. These concerns, if ignored by the passing of S7-08-20, could cause devastating effects to the U.S. securities markets if investors lose faith. The amplification effects that social media could have on the faith of skeptical investors should not be understated. Based on the aforementioned concerns, the amount of oversight required among investment managers in the way of Form 13F filings to maintain public confidence is likely to increase over time, not remain stagnant. I urge you to not pass S7-08-20."

Even if that were debatable, a 35x increase seems excessive and arbitrary. Respectfully, LARH"

Market transparency is a good thing for the health of the market. Added cost for filing holdings with the SEC is nearly $0. The majority of managers have portfolio turnover rates exceeding 100% annually so reporting quarterly holdings should not be an issue. Given that the costs associated with filing holdings is extremely negligible, ending this reporting is a bad idea. Reducing transparency removes investor confidence in the market and allows for more insider trading potential."

To put the outcome of this rule into perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers. $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight.

Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets."
Fernando Saquelares,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7432557-220085.htm,,"July 15, 2020 This rule is an abuse on the small, retail and average investors. It encourages less transparency by big or institutional funds in their intertwined interests, which the average investor uses as a data point to make wise investments. For example, a stock that has a high ratio of ownership by large funds may be a risky investment to the average Joe because the large fund may decide to dump their stake on any given day, based on insider information or other knowledge aside from fundamental data and news available to the public. In contrast, when there a stock has a low proportion of large fund institutional ownership, the average Joe may think it is a better, less manipulable stock investment and subject to a decentralized action that is not subject to the whims of a few big fish owning most of the stock. It is disgusting and appalling that the SEC is considering less transparency for large funds in times when people distrust the banks, the gap between ultra rich and medium class americans. Data shows that if the AUM threshold is raised from $100M to #3.5B per quarter, out of around 5000 funds currently required to disclose their holdings to the public, only 549 would only be left. This amount of obscurity provides a windows for corruption, manipulation of the markets and makes it harder for investors to identify risk in their investments. The average citizen has a right to invest their own money without the need to rely on a large pension fund or retirement fund management firm because these firms may have information that should be available to the public. This ruling needs to be stopped and be left as is, or, in the name of further transparency, the threshold should be decreased to $50M per quarter, instead of the current AUM of $100M. This ruling represents corruptive steps backwards in our system when transparency is needed most."

Unfortunately, little has changed since the Great Recession in terms of risk aversion and debt consolidation, and arguments that only institutional players understand the economics of obscuring trillions of dollars to save approximately $30 million are elitist at best and in bad faith at worst.

I strongly recommend the Commission revisits this proposal to amend or abandon this rule change. Having previously performed fund administration functions at a $1-$2b manager, including the responsibility of producing the data for 13F reports, I can attest to the fact that the compliance burden for this report is minimal compared to other reports and many firms have efficiently automated this responsibility. The beneficial transparency to other market participants is disproportionately higher than the effort required to produce it. As the comment prompts in the proposal indicate, this process is slightly more automated for larger managers who have the resources to construct and maintain large compliance systems, but the direct cost estimates are grossly exaggerated. The simple knowledge of fund holdings is something that all managers - regardless of size - monitor daily, if not in real-time as trades are executed intraday. Providing this information in a public filing is therefore less onerous than the production of reporting that is not valuable to the manager, and is only then complicated by the information that is omitted from the report, not what is included. In the interest of reducing the compliance burden as this proposed rule seeks to, I support the decision to remove the omission threshold regardless of whether the reporting threshold changes. While the information gained by investors from knowledge of de minimis holdings is dubious, the requirement adds marginally to the complexity of the compliance task for all firms, not just those under the materiality threshold. While I appreciate the desire to adjust the threshold to inflation to improve the relevancy of reported holdings, recalibrating the current threshold will cause a significant and immediate gap in the data going forward from firms that have reported holdings for several years but are now no longer required to do so. Alternatively, applying CPI-based adjustments going forward is a sensible approach to maintain the quality of data by ensuring that even smaller firms are not subject to inclusion in the future, while not harming investors through a loss of information in the near term. I agree with the Commission's assessment that fixing the threshold to market returns rather than an inflation metric would cause volatile changes to the threshold. Firms at the margin would need to constantly review guidance and their own performance to determine whether they were required to report, causing more of a burden than they experience today. This is also not an appropriate benchmark for many managers, specifically those that are not managing assets with long equity strategies. Regards, Rob Kimball, CFA"

Benjamin Dugas,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-219488.htm,,"Jul. 14, 2020 Hi, I firmly oppose the proposal to raise the required reporting threshold for 13F filings. “In 1978, when Form 13F was adopted, the threshold for filing the form was set at $100 million, the amount in the underlying statute and representing a certain proportionate market value of U.S. equities. Since then, the overall value of U.S. public corporate equities has grown over 30 times (from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion), and the relative significance of managing $100 million has declined considerably.” If the overall value of U.S. public corporate equities has grown over 30 times since 1978, by how much has computer technology refined automation with improved efficiency since then? Filing has become a highly automated process. The value of money might have declined considerably, but I would argue that the growth in automation in the past 40 years counterbalances that depreciation. This proposal lowers transparency in a current backdrop of increased political polarization and in an atmosphere of rising identity politics. The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. It’s all going to come crashing down without fairness in society, said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers in last week’s Wall Street Business week. Transparency breeds trust and fairness. Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago. This proposal will increase inequality even further. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, is comparing current levels of inequality to levels seen right before World War II (see attached). Most funds ask for a minimum capital requirement from investors. The better the money managers, the higher minimum capital requirements, therefore retail investors with smaller amounts of capital don’t have access to quality money managers. The proposed rule change would be a loss for main street investors that look for guidance through the 13F filings. When only the wealthy have access to qualified money managers, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”― Warren Buffett Benjamin Dugas Project Director (Attached File #1:s70820-7416001-219488.png)(Attached File #2:s70820-7416000-219488.png)"

Maxime Downs,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-219478.htm,,"Jul. 14, 2020 Hi, I firmly oppose the proposal to raise the required reporting threshold for 13F filings. “In 1978, when Form 13F was adopted, the threshold for filing the form was set at $100 million, the amount in the underlying statute and representing a certain proportionate market value of U.S. equities. Since then, the overall value of U.S. public corporate equities has grown over 30 times (from $1.1 trillion to $35.6 trillion), and the relative significance of managing $100 million has declined considerably.” If the overall value of U.S. public corporate equities has grown over 30 times since 1978, by how much has computer technology refined automation with improved efficiency since then? Filing has become a highly automated process. The value of money might have declined considerably, but I would argue that the growth in automation in the past 40 years counterbalances that depreciation. This proposal lowers transparency in a current backdrop of increased political polarization and in an atmosphere of rising identity politics. The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. It’s all going to come crashing down without fairness in society, said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers in last week’s Wall Street Business week. Transparency breeds trust and fairness. Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago. This proposal will increase inequality even further. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, is comparing current levels of inequality to levels seen right before World War II (see attached). Most funds ask for a minimum capital requirement from investors. The better the money managers, the higher minimum capital requirements, therefore retail investors with smaller amounts of capital don’t have access to quality money managers. The proposed rule change would be a loss for main street investors that look for guidance through the 13F filings. When only the wealthy have access to qualified money managers, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”― Warren Buffett Maxime Downs Controller"

There are many small investors who rely on this information. This burden, as you call it, has been assumed since 1975, and is part of the cost manager operations. Who will profit from this reduction in the cost of filings? Will it be the small investors? No,it will profit only managers. The reduction of costs to the investor, if there are any that trickels down, will never compensate for the information lost to small investors.

I believe S7-08-20 is an ill-advised change that should be rejected, since it will eliminate a vast window of transparency into US securities markets. Congress passed Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act in 1975 in order to increase the public availability of information regarding the securities holdings of institutional investors. Congress believed that this institutional disclosure program would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the United States securities markets. The SEC now suggests we reverse course by eliminating the 13(f) filing requirements for 4,500 institutional investors representing over $2.3 trillion in assets. This will undermine confidence in financial markets and in government more generally. The SEC’s recommendation is premised on the notion that 13(f) filings, which have been required for over 45 years, have become overly burdensome. This is frankly an absurd position, since in all walks of life technology has made similar ministerial tasks much faster, simpler and cheaper. In addition, the SEC’s position implicitly suggests that transparency is necessary and desirable for institutional investors managing over $3.5 billion in assets, but is overly burdensome for managers with under $3.5 billion in assets. This is naïve and/or unrealistic. One of the main purposes of transparency is to encourage and monitor regulatory compliance. Eliminate transparency for managers with under $3.5 billion in assets and we should expect a decline in regulatory compliance. Is this a policy the SEC really wants to endorse? Finally, the plain language of the Exchange Act precludes the SEC from raising the reporting threshold for 13(f) compliance. It is a mystery why the Commission would pursue a change with such legal vulnerability. Thank you, Robert W. Scannell"

Through 13F statements we are able to observe, analyze, and most importantly verify that what they tell the public matches up with their actions through their 13F disclosure documents. History has shown us fund managers have the tendency to “talk amongst themselves” where they share ideas and information. Small mom and pop investors do not have access to this level of information for their investing. The use of 13F statements is a great way for retail investors to observe the moves of large institutional traders and provides transparency if something goes wrong. Throughout history when has less transparency ever been good for American investors? I strongly discourage the idea of increasing the reporting threshold for 13F statements. The SEC has worked hard to bring to light hidden fees and outrageous commissions for the benefit of investors. Changing these transparency rules would be a big step in the wrong direction. I appreciate your consideration of this topic. I urge you not to change the reporting threshold from $100M to $3.5B. Too many managers would be excluded. From my perspective, and increase to $200M or $250M would be appropriate if any increase is required. Best Regards, Kern T.

Rick Brubaker,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-219423.htm,,"Jul. 14, 2020 Hello, I am writing to provide comments on S7-08-20. As an individual public investor for the last 10 years, I have found 13-F data to be valuable in providing transparency and leveling the playing field for investors like myself and many others in the US. 13-F filings have become a staple in the investor community, where the 45 day window post the quarter end is bookmarked on all of our calendars to learn about what other securities investors are looking at and increase collaboration. In the private markets, such as venture capital, idea sharing and opportunities are limited to an elite circle, public investing is great because ideas are democratized (albeit with a 45-day delay) and available to any individual investor. 13-Fs are unique to the US markets, and I believe it's a staple why US equities have strong levels of trust and transparency compared to other markets in the world. On the flip side, it's important for companies to understand who is their shareholder and how that can play into their investor relations strategy. Again, going through 13-Fs is a staple for many investor relations jobs and by limiting disclosure will affect the way much of this analysis is conducted today. I am requesting that the proposed rule change be considered for full withdrawal. I am happy to discuss my thoughts or perspectives with your office in case it may be helpful and greatly appreciate the consideration. Best Regards, Rick Brubaker"
Norm Ferguson,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-219402.htm,,"Jul. 14, 2020 I am against drastically reducing transparency. If there's a cost issue, perhaps something can be done to increase efficiency, or maybe a compromise from 100MM to 500MM. A 90% reduction is not wise. This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion! To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers. Sincerely, Norm Ferguson Individual Investor"

Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are. Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't.

When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor? Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. The cost of filing a 13F is very low, and would be far outweighed by the cost of losing holder information. If anything I would suggest reducing the filing threshold to $20 million. Thank you, Joe Tworek"

It is critical to our portfolio risk management to quantify a stock's aggregate concentration and liquidity risks as well as holder stress. Smaller firms cannot afford to pay stock surveillance firms for this analysis and rely on 13Fs. This will significantly reduce the small investor's ability to manage their risk. Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will limit small firms' access to company management. Public companies will only cater to the largest investors making the playing field unlevel and small firms less competitive. The copycat argument is misguided. Copycats only buy after positions are purchased and sell after positions are sold. This is supportive to a 13F filers performance. Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing, and securities.

When evaluating investments options, I very often review Form 13F reports from successful money managers who would now fall underneath this threshold - and thus I would not be able to review their filings to see if they are buying or selling the stock that I am analyzing. While I always analyze company financial statements, related SEC filings and other research (company presentations, Wall Street research reports, etc.), the Form 13F filings are an invaluable resource that are incredibly useful in my buy/sell/hold decisions.

Wall street and money managers are known to talk among themselves, thus very little transparency for main street investors as it stands now. These insiders often share ideas and information the public is not privy to. Sometimes we call this insider information or share non-public information. Very tough to prove, but this legislation would take even more transparency away from main street investors and the SEC alike. These hedge fund or Investment managers have access at their fingertips to any companies management that small investors have never had, due to resources. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field and more transparency by main street investors, this rule change makes no sense and has zero justification. The 13G/D filings are automated by legal software bought off the shelf, so the expense to any sizable fund above $50m is negligible. Do not be fooled by the cost to file logic, it's complete nonsense. These investment managers are taking on average a $2m-$25m or 5% stake in a company, but want you to think that the $150 is going to break their bankroll. If this legislation passed the SEC is literally not protecting investors, in fact the exact opposite. Currently these large high conviction purchases (over 5%) can seriously impact a public companies with low float or low volume trading, literally a large stakeholder can manipulate a stock and small investors and main street investors need to understand what is happening inside companies and who the stakeholders are to truly have a sense of what the company's future might look like. I believe the SEC ought to go the other way and make anyone taking a 5%+ position in a company must make a 13G/D SEC filing now matter the AUM of their fund and it should be done the day of the event/trade not 10 days afterwards as by then, in my experience approx 70% of these low float/ low volume stocks have pumped within 1-7 days of the high conviction position being taken and this is because of the information flow and you can't tell me much of this information flow isn't insider trading Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. This legislation wreaks of Wall street insiders writing the rules, especially when all filings are automated through software. Government, SEC, FINRA etc all talk about helping close the inclusion and inequality gaps in America. Now is your chance! This rule is the opposite of both of those goals and could be seen as racist legislation. There is a saying in investing and that is ""when in doubt widen out"" to get the full picture or essentially more transparency of the macro of the stock before you make an investment decision.

When has less transparency ever been a good idea? This change would dramatically reduce the number of filers. Form 13F was created for transparency on Wall Street. So far it has helped provide a more level playing field. Raising the threshold, and therefore reducing the number of filers, goes against that notion. Form 13F also does not need to be reviewed every 5 years to adjust the threshold. This would be a waste of time for the SEC. This rule provides transparency, and because the threshold has not been adjusted it continues to provide more transparency with each passing year. Please do not review this based on the dollar amounts still being filed, but instead view it as total number of filers. Decreasing the total number or filers by 90% is laughable. Please do not even consider this change. This change would also limit research moving forward because of the reduction in data made available to the public.

By increasing the threshold of 13F reporting from $100M to $3.5B, the SEC is reducing 90% of institutional transparency which is never a good thing for the small investors. Given that most institutions are highly automated the compliance costs are minimal and rounding error at best for the larger institutions. There is also a great disparity in wealth between the rich and poor in our society and the rule change will only increase it. It is SEC’s job to ensure that there is full transparency so that the average investor has integrity in the markets, removing transparency has the opposite effect. The SEC should not cave in to the pressure for increasing the threshold, doing so will in effect result in “the foxes looking after the chickens” . The consequences of this happening would be devastating to millions of small investors. I am pleading with SEC to not increase the threshold, please vote it down. Thank you . Raj Chhina"

A list of holdings could hardly be simpler to automatically generate. Indeed, as an individual taxpayer and investor, my Form 8949 in TY 2018 spanned 7 pages, none of which I filled out individually. I can't imagine who, even if only a single person, could possibly be burdened simply by disclosing holdings on a quarterly basis, regardless of the quantity, in the the year of Our Lord 2020.The question of burden can be easily dispatched. Now one can turn our attention to the utility. Regardless of the level of burden, if there is no utility to We The People, there is an argument to be made. And once again, it is a silly one. From the industry that brought this country the Great Mortgage Crisis of 2008/9/10/11/12/13 comes a claim that 90% of firms can be trusted to operate without disclosure. This is akin to allowing 300M US citizens to not file a tax return, to rely solely on their W4 to accurately assess their taxation and assume that each of them is acting in good faith. This scheme would not garner much support and rightfully so.Lastly, disclosure rules appear to be the only means by which the SEC can reliably enforce regulation in the financial industry. Thusly, allowing a great many smaller firms to escape the primary means of enforcement can only reinforce the brazen abandon with which the entire financial sector treats the life savings, pensions, retirement accounts, mortgages and houses, and college educations of US citizens. The SEC is in need of every possible tool to enforce law on this industry and on that ground, this rule could not be more wrong."

"Wayne Bloch, Esq., RHP",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7417035-219532.htm,,"July 14, 2020 Subject: File No. S7-08-20 -- Reporting Thresholds for Institutional Investment Managers Ladies and Gentlemen- In concept, raising the 13(f) reporting thresholds after 45 years makes sense. $100M of 13(f) assets under management is, quite literally, not what it used to be. But focusing on market size, instead of simple inflation, is nonsensical here, because the market is also not what it used to be. In 1975, there were no ETFs and the concept of passive investing had just been invented by the legendary John Bogle. It's stunning that the otherwise thorough analysis in your release seeking comment never mentions the percentage of the market that remains actively managed vs passively managed. But a truly transparent, meaningful analysis requires focus on that information. Your analysis states: ""In the years since 1975, the overall size of the U.S. equities market has grown at a rate significantly higher than the CPI or PCE. The legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed to focus on larger managers. We therefore believe that relying on a consumer price inflation measure such as CPI or PCE to account for 45 years of market growth would not adequately or appropriately capture the holdings and universe of managers contemplated by section 13(f)."" But active management (and the managers engaged in active management) is what counts now in the context of 13(f), and that differentiation was absent in 1975. Since far less of the market is actively managed now, a much lower threshold than $3.5B is in order to capture transparent information from active managers. Currently, about 50% of the market is passively managed, and it's likely to continue rapidly growing from here. Based on your own CPI and PCE inflation data, the 13(f) reporting thresholds should most wisely be set at about $500m (which would negate the filing requirement for 63% of current filers) or maybe as high as $1B (negating the filing requirement for 76% of current filers). As far as burden goes, the forms should be simplified. Respectfully submitted, Wayne Bloch"

Under the current reporting guidelines there is a glimpse of transparency which makes our Exchanges extraordinarily open to investors of all sizes, failing to continue operating in the way all investors have access to this information directly impacts the freedom of the market, it is difficult enough to compete in this market with companies that have access to more information and capital than small investors, coupled that inequity with diminished information on where companies under that threshold are operating and the activities they are conducting and you will find greater inequity and lack of transparency. Driebusch and Ching (2020) have stated that nearly 90 percent of current filers would end such disclosures of 13Fs.I would probe the causes of such move by the SEC and whether there is a correlation with easier access to these Exchanges by the average American, where he/she no longer has to rely on an investment firm or paid trading accounts to invest in the market. This may very well be a plain conjecture, however, the timing of your proposal festers the average American, furthermore, the argument that this move is simply to proportionately reflect current market values is unconvincing and shamefully absurd, a firm managing funds upwards of $100 million can certainly and without a doubt afford a filing fee and compliance costs of $30,000 annually, being a infinitesimal fraction of the entire portfolio, moreover, the proceeds received from fees and penalties by the SEC ought to be utilized to increase 13F compliance and accuracy. I hope that the SEC reconsiders its position on this topic and discards the idea to increase the reporting threshold merely to appease institutions with portfolios less than $3.5 billion.

Indeed, disclosures of short positions, as they are required in Europe, would be even more helpful, but this proposed regulatory change is going the wrong way. Additional monitoring costs that investors will need to bear if 13F filings are no longer required for all but the few largest managers will likely far outweigh any reduced compliance costs related to managers. Alternatively, if the SEC wishes to press forward with a threshold increase, I suggest that the current $100m threshold be increased to $500m to achieve a goal of reducing business costs to emerging managers while still enabling investor due diligence needed where most of the money is invested. For example, among hedge fund firms, according to HFRI, roughly 75% of hedge fund managers have assets under $500m, while about 95% of hedge fund assets are managed by those firms with over $500m. A $3.5b threshold is too high to make sense, given the degradation of investor due diligence capabilities where needed most. 13Fs are one of the few tools available to investors who are willing to ""trust but verify"" managers within the world of unregulated private funds. Such public filings help to ensure an honest conversation between managers and investors. Who is the SEC working for - the investing public or investment management industry lobbyists? This proposed regulatory change with a $3.5b threshold may become a lightening rod of public opinion revolting against an SEC straying from its original mission. Helping wealthy hedge fund managers, especially those with over $500m in assets, at the expense of the public investment community will be hard to justify in any reasonable cost/benefit analysis. More time spent by $500m managers helped by this regulatory compliance relief on enhanced price discovery? Probably. Enhanced price discovery from a $3.49b manager?

As someone that has invested through a fund manager, there is always a concern over whether anything irregular is occurring and if my investment is safe. Changing this threshold seems to be direct conflict with what is best for the common retail investor. Nearly 5300 funds report today, once this changes, only 550 will report. How is this a good thing? All of these Funds charge 2/20 type fees, they can afford to comply with these regulations, as a small business owner myself, I can certainly see the need to deregulate, but some things are important and necessary to prevent massive fraud.

Changing the threshold to those in the proposed rule would eviscerate the value of 13F reporting. Yes, the larger funds may control a high percentage of invested capital, but following smaller funds who can be more nimble, identify smaller cap stocks beginning to break out or are selling a stock is where some of the best research is done. Again, I understand the data is delayed, and some may rely on it for the wrong reasons, but that is no reason to change something which appears to be working well. Maybe the threshold should be moved up slightly, but please don't go anywhere near what the rule is proposing. That would be a serious mistake for an Agency whose mission is built around ""full and fair disclosure"".

These insiders often share ideas and information the public is not privy too. Sometimes we call this insider information or sharing non public information. Very tough to prove, but this legislation would take even more transparency away from main street investors and the SEC alike. The legislation is going the wrong way These hedge fund or Investment managers have access at their fingertips to any companies management that small investors have never had, due to resources.Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field and more transparency by main street investors, this rule change makes no sense and has zero justification. The 13G/D filings are automated by legal software bought off the shelf, so the expense to any sizable fund above $50m is negligible. Do not be fooled by the cost to file logic.These investment managers are taking on average a $2m-$25m or 5% stake in a company, but want you to think that the $150 is going to break their bankroll. If this legislation passed the SEC is literally not protecting investors, in fact the exact opposite. Currently these large high conviction purchases (over 5%) can seriously impact a public companies with low float or low volume trading, literally a large stakeholder can manipulate a stock and small investors and main street investors need to understand what is happening inside companies and who the stakeholders are to truly have a sense of what the company's future might look like. I believe the SEC ought to go the other way and make anyone taking a 5%+ position in a company must make a 13G/D SEC filing now matter the AUM of their fund and it should be done the day of the event/trade not 10 days afterwards as by then, in my experience approx 70% of these low float/ low volume stocks have pumped within 1-7 days of the high conviction position being taken and this is because of the information flow and you can't tell me much of this information flow isn't insider trading Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk. This legislation wreaks of Wall street insiders writing the rules when all filings are automated through software. Government, SEC, FINRA etc all talk about helping close the inclusion and inequality gaps in America. This rule is the opposite of both of those goals and could be seen as racist legislation. There is a saying in investing and that is ""when in doubt widen out"" to get the full picture or essentially more transparency of the macro of the stock before you make an investment decision. This legislation only focuses on helping wall street, when will the SEC actually help main street investors? Marc"

For years, I have used 13F filings as one of many information gathering tools to help inform my investment decisions. I strongly I disagree with the decision to move up the reporting threshold to $3.5B because I believe it will harm small investors like myself. You are eliminating a small, but important, piece of information that helps all investors (especially small ones) make educated decisions and instead making the market more opaque and similar to European equity markets. To reiterate, the decision will harm small investors by leaving them without vital information to make educated investing decisions. If you are going to raise the minimum threshold, $250-$500M would make more sense in my opinion. In addition, having worked for many years in the hedge fund industry, I believe that the benefits of the savings to hedge fund organizations (or more broadly investment organizations) is very much exaggerated. In truth, this amount of money they will save is likely immaterial to the organizations compared with the (unnecessary) service/value you are providing by hiding their positions to outside investors. What they really want is to be able to disclose less, and hide their positions. I think the current standard (quarterly, 45 day lag) is sufficient in providing the necessary information without leaking any of the key elements of investment organizations' investment process.

For the potential and/or existing investor, form 13F provides immense transparency into the recent and past investments of the investment manager. In today's age of super-marketing, form 13F provides an objective way to verify whether the investment manager's execution is aligned with his/her investment philosophy. Similarly, form 13F also provides, ongoing evidence that the investment manager is continuing with his/her investment style as initially promised and is not swaying away from it. Absent of this form, the existing investor would be at the mercy of the investment manager, to communicate the investments s/he is making. It could be too late before the investor recognizes that the investment manager has departed from his philosophy and may not be able to get out of an investment partnership or hedge fund in time to save his/her investment. Form 13F also serves a purpose of educating budding investment managers or individual investors, about the different investment choices of more established investors. Today the individual investor, can look at the investments of an investment manager by looking at his/her 13F form. Tomorrow, if the SEC removes the access to this tool for an individual investor and the investor makes an investment and loses, s/he may hold SEC responsible for their loss. As the individual investor was deprived of a source to validate an investment manager's philosophy and had to rely simply on the investment manager's marketing material. I am not a legal expert, but if enough situations like the aforementioned were to happen, can it result in a class-action lawsuit filed against the SEC? You may want to think about the reputational damage, one or more such instances could do to your esteemed organization. In my opinion, the benefits offered to investment managers are negligible, whilst the reduction of transparency is a significant and detrimental loss for individual investors."
Ellis Kim,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7418394-219690.htm,,"July 14, 2020 I am writing to express my view that a $3.5 billion reporting threshold is far too high. Although I can appreciate a $100mm threshold might be burdensome for small managers, by the time a manager reaches even $500mm of assets, that manager is typically quite profitable and quite capable of adhering to quarterly filing requirements. To raise the reporting threshold to $3.5 billion deprives individual investors like me the opportunity to see which types of investors are driving stocks up and down. Institutional investors are able to get color from broker-dealers, but individual investors have to rely on freely available data, such as SEC filings. A much higher reporting threshold only serves to increase the information asymmetry between institutional and individual investors."

Where else can an investor get the transparency to make an informed decision? Only the 13F supplies that information. Since the 13F comes out after a 3 month delay there is nojustifiable confidential concerns because the positions are old. As far as cost that isn't true as much of the accounting work is automated anyway. Sadly the only group this proposal benefits are the largest of HFs because they will provide the data.

Increasing the threshold might even hamper competition because smaller managers will face marketing challenges and additional costs to provide verifiable data to potential clients.I reject the contention that front running is even possible, given the delay in publishing the data. There is also no proof that copycatting of portfolios has any impact on prices or costs. If anything, this practice would benefit the holdings of these managers by providing additional buying pressure.

Worst of all, raising the threshold for these reporting requirements would deprive virtually all retail investors and corporations of critical investment information. How is a current $100 million reporting requirement too low? With that level of investment, the reporting costs are not that significant. Investment funds, mutual funds, and others subject to this reporting, are part of a ""tribe"" who share common circles and speak to each other regularly. They share information among themselves and this regulation would do nothing to change that. As a result, by allowing this information to be ""hidden"" simply deprives the public, especially retail investors, of key information on making investment decisions. However, it allows a high level of secrecy to the benefit of those who would no longer subject to this transparency. One other consideration is that this information is used for academic research, analysis, and education. Eliminating it from the public view stifles the associated financial education.

Smaller firms cannot afford to pay stock surveillance firms for this analysis and rely on 13Fs. This will significantly reduce the small investor's ability to manage their risk.

Copycats only buy after positions are purchased and sell after positions are sold. This is supportive to a 13F filers performance.

To eliminate 90% of required fillings would undoubtedly hinder broad market transparency and oversight of individual managers, all at a seemingly nominal (if at all) cost savings to managers and the SEC, and with zero reasonably estimable and direct benefit to investors/clients. This proposal DIRECTLY contradicts SEC mandates to inform and protect investors, ultimately inhibits ability to enforce security laws, and significantly reduces data available to ""Main Street"" investors. When and on what planet is less data a positive for market participants, particularly American households which, according to the SEC, own $29 trillion of equities, or 58% of the market?

Having the transparency of investment strategies employed by investment managers will lead to a lower likelihood of potential fraud to the investors in those funds.

The proposed changes can only increase the dominance of a few select firms with access to management of filers, and as a result reduce competitiveness, to the detriment of investors and firms. Additionally this decision would be a move away from the harmonisation to European reporting requirements and international standards of best practice. I feel that this change to reporting requirements is against the grain and the trend towards improving the transparency and access of information, as well as being a poor decision overall for the investment community.

This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion! To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers. $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight. When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of [the US] securities markets.” Taking this data away will have the opposite effect. Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets. This is an absurd proposal, I have over 2 million dollars invested in the US stock market and I rely heavily on 13F's to base my decisions. If this passes, I will remove 80% at least of my equity in the US market and trade other international markets. The reason people invest in US equities is because of transparency and reliability. IF you take that away, you're just like any other market, and people will move to other markets where the returns are much higher. Thank you Hope you can convince legislators of the absurdity of this all. --"

As I was learning about markets and investing my savings before eventually entering the financial industry, access to filings of holdings from various investors was an invaluable tool for me to develop my own understanding of markets. Giving small investors access to this information helps to level the playing field in markets by allowing them to see where the smart money is and reverse-engineer the theses driving these investments. This helped me a lot early in my career, and continues to be an important tool for many individuals who play the markets. Cutting this out reduces transparency in an industry that is already short in that department, for a minimal cost savings. I could see raising the threshold slightly, say to $100mm, but raising to $3.5Bn would exclude a huge number of sizable and important firms from this requirement and should not be done."

This is an extremely important part of our diligence. I have never had a manager complain about the added burden of filing a 13F. By raising the AUM threshold to $3.5bn you are effectively putting these smaller managers at a significant disadvantage by making it more difficult for investment groups to do their diligence and get comfortable moving forward with an investment.

Removal of filings would make it harder for smaller investors to thoroughly vet smaller managers. Filings can help investors assess a manager's portfolio and whether the firm invests the way it purports to. The filings can be particularly helpful when it comes to managers that invest in small-cap stocks. Institutional investors such as pension funds have almost unlimited access to speak, visit, and review fund performance. Sometimes on a daily basis. 13-F filing changes would disadvantage the smaller investor who does not have the same access.Costs - 13-F filing costs are not the main concern for hedge funds. Technology has made this quite automated anyways. It is not in the best interest of the smaller investor to remove simple and cheap transparency measures. What is the rate of fraud in private placement investments verses hedge funds subject to 13-F filing requirements? Removing this simple accountability measure would put smaller investors at greater risk. Hedge funds eliminating simple disclosures would shift the industry to become akin to private placements. The added costs of due diligence when evaluating funds are transferred to each individual investor. This does not reduce costs from the system, and any reduced cost observed would come at the increased risk of fraud. The SEC website itself provides an Investor Alert for Private Placements.

With the advent of free training platforms there are now many more retail investors. There is also a rise of social platforms/influencers posing as sources of investment advice. Unless the SEC can crack down on thousands of questionable scenarios, having a reliable tool (13F filings) that specifies ownership, is the best way to protect investors from being duped by pump and dump schemes. Currently, 13F filings are delayed by 45 days. This is plenty of time for an institution to build a position. So the ""front running"" and ""copy catting"" arguments are moot. If the reporting threshold is raised significantly (from 100 million to 3.5 billion). Overly competitive investment managers now have an incentive to break up (artificially) into smaller entities to avoid filing a 13F. Filing four times a year can be done for a cost in the thousands. This is not a barrier. It is not only retail investors that will be negatively impacted, but also accredited investors/ high net worth individuals. As an investment manager can now run a fund in relative obscurity. Forced public reporting holds them accountable. In conclusion, 13F filings bring transparency of ownership that can be a valuable aid for doing due diligence on a publicly traded company. This protects investors from pump and dump schemes, and allows for informed investment decisions. Creating a position is not inhibited as 45 days is enough of a delay. Institutions will circumvent reporting by breaking into smaller entities. High net worth/accredited investors who invest in said funds will not have the same transparency. Overall market participation will be negatively impacted. This is my opinion."
Steven Campbell,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7414797-219271.htm,,"July 13, 2020 I am strongly opposed to the main change proposed in the proposed rule S7-08-20, but several of the smaller proposals are useful. Regarding the proposed reporting threshold, increasing it by using growth of the equity market or returns is not a valid measure. Much has changed since 1975 and the burden for reporting is much less now that records are kept electronically. Raising this threshold would negatively impact the utility of Form 13(f) data. Personally speaking, it would reduce my confidence in the Security and Exchange Commission, which is additionally held in high esteem worldwide. It appears this rule would throw transparency and oversight - the whole purpose of the SEC - out the window. I do not believe the obligations of 13F requirements are more burdensome to smaller managers in the technology age. In 1975 this argument was valid, but it is not 45 years ago. Form 13F data is important to many people, from other institutional investors as well as retail investors. For retail investors, the argument that the majority of holdings by dollar is still captured with the increased reporting threshold is not valid. Retail investors who study 13F filings would prefer to use 13F data from large and smaller firms alike. This is the only source of this information and changing this requirement would significantly decrease transparency and the legitimacy of the 13F system. The proposed removal of the omission threshold is a good move. As is shown in that section, there is little additional burden to produce this data. I also find the proposed requirement to provide CRD numbers and SEC filing numbers useful and will not add any new burden. Furthermore, the technical proposal to require rounding to the nearest dollar is a good idea. It does not increase the burden of filing. In summary, I find that several of the proposals are useful, but the main proposal is problematic - the reporting threshold must stay at $100 million in order to maintain the SEC's mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. Increasing this threshold is a complete dereliction and conscious negligence of the SEC's Constitutionally-bound duties and could lead to the delegitimization of American markets and the demise of American leadership in the financial sector worldwide. This is not what any of us want to see Maintaining the 13F reporting threshold as currently implemented continues to promote transparency and an efficient financial sector."

Transparency beneficial if a fund is accumulating an excess of a particular asset. It also identifies investment opportunities. Computers make data collection easy.

Forms and regulations should be updated regularly for both efficiency, effectiveness and greater transparency. I'll comment on only one aspect of the proposed rule change - the required filing threshold. Raising the current threshold from $100 million in assets to $3.5 billion simply means the SEC, the one regulatory oversight commission has decided to allow 90% of institutional investors to hide their assets. I'm not sure who talked who into this, but all parties involved seem to be motivated by greed and power and a ""hidden agenda"" which we all know is not hidden at all. Transparency of information is regarded as a strength, greed is regarded as a weak link. No one enjoys the process of competing forms, well perhaps accountants. So I propose simplifying the forms by 90%. Maintain the threshold of $100 million in assets as institutional investors' behavior is what is regulated, not money. The SEC was established due to institutional investors' inappropriate and illegal behavior, remember? Just simplify the forms by 90% by requiring both assets and short positions listed that are held on a specified date, require these forms to be filed within 10 days (as they will be simplified by 90%) and do not allow for requests by institutional investors for ""confidential treatment"". Those are not only my thoughts, but I speak on behalf of those who are not institutional investors and even some clients of institutional investors. Thank you for your consideration and time.

The costs of filing the 13F is miniscule for an individual managers with all the data readily available in IT systems. With the raise of active ETFs who disclose their holdings daily (who are not at all concerned), it difficult to justify any costs such as front running or copy catting from disclosed holdings after 45 days after the end of a quarter.

Look at China, they will never garnish the same premiums that the US market can produce because they refuse to abide by the same standards of transparency. When you limit transparency, you limit price discovery. PE multiples will fall. Thank you."
Muskan Thacker,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7409696-219181.htm,,"July 11, 2020 Ladies and Gentlemen Investors worldwide have an inherent trust in the way the SEC regulates US capital markets. This trust is extremely unique and does not exist with any other country without exception. One of the most useful and credible aspects of the current regulation is 'transparency' of information as to the owners of a public listed entity. This allows investors and companies the transparency to see the type and nature of shareholders, even if it is 45 days after the quarter end. Submitting holdings 4 times a year to the regulator is not onerous in time or money for any money manager regardless of their size. They know their holdings all day and night and whether they use IT systems or a simple spreadsheet, it is a good discipline and promotes healthy transparency on which the US attracts trillions in capital each year. Please do not remove this pillar of the system by raising the threashold to 3.5bn which will exclude far too many 'significant' hedge funds and mutual fund groups. The U.S will need to continue to attract foreign capital and actions such as this will begin to gradually erode the long held trust. Kind Regards Muskan Thacker"
James Finn,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7409677-219161.htm,,"July 11, 2020 The proposed increase in the threshold of $3.5B for 13F reporting is too high an incremental jump from the current $100M. 13F filings facilitate thorough vetting of smaller managers, helping to assess a managers portfolio and whether the management invests the way it claims. Removing this valuable tool by eliminating the requirment for many more small funds will reduce the ability of the smaller investor to properly conduct due diligence. The proposed threshold increase should be significantly reduced."
Benjamin J. Creasy,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7409674-219162.htm,,"July 11, 2020 As an active retail investor, I appreciate knowing which big companies own which stocks. It gives me a small advantage relative to the vast advantages that institutional investors have over the small retail investor. Further, we live in an age of automation, which should allow compliance costs to drop dramatically. And there's a wealth of scholarship and analysis from these filings which have improved the overall strength and liquidity of our financial system. Financial markets benefit from transparency. Finally, prior to this proposal, I have not seen any discussions raised in public. In the rule (https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf), footnote 29 refers to File No. S7-51-02 (Feb. 14, 2003) from Fund Democracy and Consumer Federation of America. Is that the most recent request? Who is really fighting for this? Thank you for considering my request."

If this happens, expect a lot of market manipulation based on hedge fund play. By the public seeing the value of holdings on a quarterly basis, the individual investor can be assured of the amount of institutional ownership that is in a stock. That gives us confidence in our positions."
"Markunas Michael Markunas, Chief Compliance Officer, B. Riley Family of Regulated Entities",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7409702-219195.htm,,"July 10, 2020 On behalf of the B. Riley family of regulated entities, we wholeheartedly endorse raising the threshold for reporting 13-f holdings. The administrative and compliance costs associated with such filings place an undue burden on small firms while arguably providing little in the way of usable investor data. Further, we would endorse pegging the 13-F filing threshold to the average rate of return earned by the markets annually, inclusive of dividends and rounded to the nearest $100M, during the 45 years that the rule has been in existence. Finally, we would endorse eliminating the omission threshold for reporting purposes. While we agree that these small positions provide little in the way informational value, having the option to remove them adds an extra layer of analysis and review that increases the regulatory burden.

Eric Gonzalez,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7409700-219193.htm,,"July 10, 2020 I strongly disagree with the proposed changes to 13F filings, which will lead to significantly lower transparency to the general public. A firm with $500M or more in assets is sizable enough to merit reporting, and the burden due unto them has been exaggerated for political purposes. I say this as someone familiar with the individuals who have to prepare and pay for these filings. Moreover, in a time where the average American is more disconnected for the wealth centers of our country, I find any motion to reduce transparency to be offensive to hardworking backbone of our economy (which often lacks access to these centers of wealth). I am submitting this comment as a private citizen with regard only to my own views and implications to my private life."
